Privacy policies contain privacy-related requirements about how the personal data of individuals will be handled by an organization or a software system (e.g., a web service or an app). In Europe, privacy policies are subject to compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A prerequisite for GDPR compliance checking is to verify whether the content of a privacy policy is complete according to the provisions of GDPR. Incomplete privacy policies might result in large fines on violating organization as well as incomplete privacy-related software specifications. Manual completeness checking is both time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we propose AI-based automation for the completeness checking of privacy policies. Through systematic qualitative methods, we first build two artifacts to characterize the privacy-related provisions of GDPR, namely a conceptual model and a set of completeness criteria. Then, we develop an automated solution on top of these artifacts by leveraging a combination of natural language processing and supervised machine learning. Specifically, we identify the GDPR-relevant information content in privacy policies and subsequently check them against the completeness criteria. To evaluate our approach, we collected 234 real privacy policies from the fund industry. Over a set of 48 unseen privacy policies, our approach detected 300 of the total of 334 violations of some completeness criteria correctly, while producing 23 false positives. The approach thus has a precision of 92.9% and recall of 89.8%. Compared to a baseline that applies keyword search only, our approach results in an improvement of 24.5% in precision and 38% in recall.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.","2022-11-01","2025-01-08 21:06:15","2025-01-08 21:17:01","","4647-4674","","11","48","","IEEE Trans Software Eng","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","WOS:000881981800023","","","Number: 11 Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<p>Export Date: 18 December 2024; Cited By: 23; Correspondence Address: S.

However, technology is radically changing how public administration is organised and reliance on Artificial Intelligence is on the rise across all sectors. While carrying the promise of an increasingly efficient administration, automating (parts of) administrative decision-making processes also poses a challenge to our human-centred systems of control of public power. This article focuses on one of these control mechanisms: the duty to give reasons under EU law, a pillar of administrative law designed to enable individuals to challenge decisions and courts to exercise their powers of review. First, it analyses whether the duty to give reasons can be meaningfully applied when EU bodies rely on AI systems to inform their decision-making. Secondly, it examines the added value of secondary law, in particular the data protection rules applicable to EU institutions and the draft EU Artificial Intelligence Act, in complementing and adapting the duty to give reasons to better fulfil its purpose in a (partially) automated administration. This article concludes that the duty to give reasons provides a useful starting point but leaves a number of aspects unclear. While providing important safeguards, neither EU data protection law nor the draft EU Artificial Intelligence Act currently fill these gaps. © 2022 Thomson Reuters and Contributors.","2022-06","2025-01-08 21:06:19","2025-01-08 21:20:44","","376-392","","3","47","","Eur.

Methodology-In terms of methodology, we use the qualitative approach, where the data analysis technique is discourse analysis and the unit of analysis are official documents and reports related to disruptive technologies for judicial use, emphasizing those dedicated to ""experience""Colombian with the Pretoria AI. Findings-In Latin America, AI Systems, such as Victor and PretorIA, are automation tools supporting synthesis and prediction tasks in the supreme courts in Brazil and Colombia. However, they are not magic solutions to solve judicial congestion, although the 4th Industrial Revolution bring progress for positive changes. The significant challenges, however, are also in law theory through an ethical framework for the development, design, and operational work of AI. Nevertheless, our comprehension of those systems remains limited. For this reason, supreme courts must observe positive law and ethics to avoid a tyranny of the code, avoiding their impact over law sources', preventing an algorithm from ""deciding""the criteria for applying the law. Thus, supreme courts need to calibrate and influence its design, preventing its obsolescence, but, above all, preventing human dignity obsolescence, human labor, and power of deliberation. All these are essential for shaping version 4.0 of the Social Rule of Law. Practical implications-Promote the engagement of magistrates and citizenship in design and programming of AI Systems for supreme courts' use, within an ethical framework that prevents human beings, their values, and their rights' obsolescence. Originality-This paper analyzes AI Systems used to solve supreme courts' problems in Brazil and Colombia, studying how they work, but also its additional features considering theories that allow affirming that programming and design are subject to the Rule of Law rules and a Human Rights oriented ethical framework. © 2021 The Author(s).","2021","2025-01-08 21:06:22","2025-01-08 21:06:22","","143-169","","1","13","","Rev.

While the ways in which legal professionals process and share information have evolved with new technologies — primarily with the emergence of personal computers, email and the internet — these technologies have not fundamentally transformed it. However, if media reports are to be believed, advances in technology in general — and the field known as ""Artificial Intelligence"" (AI) in particular — are on lawyers' doorsteps, and the legal industry is on the cusp of radical change. Fuelled by big data, increased computing power and more effective algorithms, AI has the potential to fundamentally transform the way in which legal work is done, the way in which law firms conduct business, and the way in which lawyers deal with clients. A number of technologies that fall under the AI umbrella, such as machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning and others, have already brought about the automation of many tasks that were, until recently, performed exclusively by humans because they required human intelligence. AI systems can also be used to perform many tasks that lawyers routinely perform, such as contract analysis, case prediction and e-discovery. And, according to proponents, these emerging technologies can do it cheaper, faster and more efficiently. This contribution examines the notion that recent advances in technology will ""disrupt"" the legal profession. It first describes the astonishing advances in technological progress, especially the recent rise of AI. It then considers the technologies and areas of legal practice most susceptible to this disruption. It concludes by envisaging what AI might mean for the legal profession, and how current technological trends might, in a relatively short period of time, transform the way in which legal services are delivered. © 2020, North-West Unversity.

Part I briefly describes some of the ways AI is already in use in ordinary life-from facial recognition, through medical diagnosis to translation services. Part II describes how AI is transforming what it means to provide legal services in six primary areas: Litigation review; expertise automation; legal research; contract analytics; contract and litigation document generation; and predictive analytics. Part III explores who are the providers of these AI driven legal services-often non-lawyer legal service providers-and how these providers are replacing at least some of what clients have traditionally sought from lawyers. Part III also discusses the implications of all these changes both for the future role of lawyers individually, and in particular what services will clients still need lawyers to perform: Judgment, empathy, creativity and adaptability. In turn, this Part examines what will these changes mean for the size, shape, composition and economic model of law firms, as well as the implications of these changes for legal education and lawyer training. Part IV identifies the principal legal, ethical, regulatory and risk management issues raised by the use of AI in the provision of legal services. Finally, in Part V the article considers who will be the likely providers of AI based services other than law firms: Legal publishers, major accounting firms and venture capital funded businesses. © 2020 Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Escola de Direito de Sao Paulo.

Since Finland launched an experiment which examines the introduction of a UBI as a possible solution to these changes at the beginning of 2017, certain legal as well as socio-economic aspects will be pointed out that generally have to be considered by national governments when introducing a UBI. The second part of the essay focuses on possible different designs of the so-called ""Robot-tax"" which recently has been one of the central point of debate in relation to the overtaking of typically human jobs by AI and their impact on state finances. The two different scenarios, referred to A and B, represent the basis for a possibly necessary adaptation within social security law as well as the tax law sector. The main reason we chose to discuss the possible implementation of a UBI and of a ""Robot-tax"", instead of other possible measures, is that current discussions, especially within Europe, mainly focus on exactly these instruments. © 2019, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche.

This paper draws attention to the question of how to safeguard the right to a fair trial in the light of rapidly changing technologies significantly affecting the judiciary and enabling automation of the civil procedure. The paper does not intend to comprehensively address all aspects related to the right to a fair trial in the context of the automation of civil proceedings but rather seeks to analyse some legal concerns from the perspective of the Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. Section 1 discusses the issues of using artificial intelligence in the justice and automation of the judicial proceedings. Section 2 is devoted to the judge supporting system based on artificial intelligence and psychological requirements of its practical use. Section 3 presents the right to a fair trial in civil cases established by the Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, while subsequent sections characterize its elements with respect to the possibility to automate civil proceedings: a right to have case heard within a reasonable time in section 4 and a right to a reasoned judgment in section 5. © 2019, Masaryk University Journal of Law and Technology.

The approaches are very diverse: the scope of the provision can be narrow (just automated decisions producing legal or similarly detrimental effects) or wide (any decision with a significant impact) and even specific safeguards proposed are very diverse. After this overview, this article will also address the following questions: are Member States free to broaden the scope of automated decision-making regulation? Are ‘positive decisions’ allowed under Article 22, GDPR, as some Member States seem to affirm? Which safeguards can better guarantee rights and freedoms of the data subject? In particular, while most Member States refers just to the three safeguards mentioned at Article 22(3) (i.e. subject's right to express one's point of view; right to obtain human intervention; right to contest the decision), three approaches seem very innovative: a) some States guarantee a right to legibility/explanation about the algorithmic decisions (France and Hungary); b) other States (Ireland and United Kingdom) regulate human intervention on algorithmic decisions through an effective accountability mechanism (e.g. notification, explanation of why such contestation has not been accepted, etc.); c) another State (Slovenia) require an innovative form of human rights impact assessments on automated decision-making. © 2019 The Authors","2019-10","2025-01-08 21:06:35","2025-01-08 21:17:07","","","","5","35","","Comput Law Secur.

More specifically, it examines the ways in which a lawyer’s ethical capabilities and motivations are tested by the rapid growth of automated systems, both to identify the ethical risks posed by AI tools in legal services, and to uncover what is required of lawyers when they use this technology. To do so, we use psychologist James Rest’s Four-component Model of Morality (FCM), which represents the necessary elements for lawyers to engage in professional conduct when utilising AI. We examine issues associated with automation that most seriously challenge each component in context, as well as the skills and resolve lawyers need to adhere to their ethical duties. Importantly, this approach is grounded in social psychology. That is, by looking at human ‘thinking and doing’ (i.e., lawyers’ motivations and capacity when using AI), this offers a different, complementary perspective to the typical, legislative approach in which the law is analysed for regulatory gaps. © The Author/s 2019","2019","2025-01-08 21:06:40","2025-01-08 21:06:40","","80-99","","1","1","","Law.

Recently, inspired by the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in the generic domain, many LegalAI researchers devote their effort to applying PLMs to legal tasks. However, utilizing PLMs to address legal tasks is still challenging, as the legal documents usually consist of thousands of tokens, which is far longer than the length that mainstream PLMs can process. In this paper, we release the Longformer-based pre-trained language model, named as Lawformer, for Chinese legal long documents understanding. We evaluate Lawformer on a variety of LegalAI tasks, including judgment prediction, similar case retrieval, legal reading comprehension, and legal question answering. The experimental results demonstrate that our model can achieve promising improvement on tasks with long documents as inputs.

Yet judges are confronting machine learning algorithms with increasing frequency, including in criminal, administrative, and civil cases. This Essay argues that judges should demand explanations for these algorithmic outcomes. One way to address the “black box” problem is to design systems that explain how the algorithms reach their conclusions or predictions. If and as judges demand these explanations, they will play a seminal role in shaping the nature and form of “explainable AI” (xAI). Using the tools of the common law, courts can develop what xAI should mean in different legal contexts. There are advantages to having courts to play this role: Judicial reasoning that builds from the bottom up, using case-by-case consideration of the facts to produce nuanced decisions, is a pragmatic way to develop rules for xAI. Further, courts are likely to stimulate the production of different forms of xAI that are responsive to distinct legal settings and audiences. More generally, we should favor the greater involvement of public actors in shaping xAI, which to date has largely been left in private hands. © 2019, Columbia Law Review Association.

This paper first describes the four core elements of today's digital power concentration, which need to be seen in cumulation and which, seen together, are both a threat to democracy and to functioning markets. It then recalls the experience with the lawless Internet and the relationship between technology and the law as it has developed in the Internet economy and the experience with GDPR before it moves on to the key question for AI in democracy, namely which of the challenges of AI can be safely and with good conscience left to ethics, and which challenges of AI need to be addressed by rules which are enforceable and encompass the legitimacy of democratic process, thus laws. The paper closes with a call for a new culture of incorporating the principles of democracy, rule of law and human rights by design in AI and a three-level technological impact assessment for new technologies like AI as a practical way forward for this purpose.

This aim is formulated according to the technical capabilities integrated in SAI and the SAI's ability to interact independently with other legal subjects. SAI features, such as direct connection with intellectual skills, the ability to understand, learn and make autonomous decisions may cause situations where autonomous systems based on AI will make decisions which will be in the best interests of individuals, even though conflicting with the user's own will. To consider the possibility of SAI being recognized as possessing legal personality, we analyse the concept and features of SAI and define its operating principles. We give hypothetical examples to demonstrate the necessity of SAIs being recognized as such. The paper undertakes legal personality analysis of SAI performed: (i) using the philosophical and legal concepts of a subject (person); (ii) discussing artificial (unnatural subjects of law) as an alternative to the recognition of legal personality of SAI; (iii) using elements of legal personality set for natural and legal persons. The analysis leads to the conclusion that the scope of SAI rights and obligations will not necessarily be the same as the scope of rights and obligations of other subjects of law. Thus, SAI could only have rights and obligations that are strictly defined by legislators. This conclusion suggests that the result of this paper may be its use in further research defining the scope of SAI rights and obligations. © 2017 Paulius Čerka, Jurgita Grigienė, & Gintarė Sirbikytė","2017-10-01","2025-01-08 21:06:54","2025-01-08 21:06:54","","685-699","","5","33","","Computer Law & Security Review","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","ScienceDirect","","Number: 5 Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Export Date: 18 December 2024; Cited By: 72; Correspondence Address: J.

The proposed approach can be helpful for police and other law enforcement bodies in India for controlling and preventing crime region-wise. In the proposed approach different regression models are built based on different regression algorithms, viz., random forest regression (RFR), decision tree regression (DTR), multiple linear regression (MLR), simple linear regression (SLR), and support vector regression (SVR) after pre-processing the data using MySQL Workbench and R programming. These regression models can predict 28 different types of IPC cognizable crime counts and also a total number of Indian Penal Code (IPC) cognizable crime counts region-wise, state-wise, and year-wise (for all over the country) provided the desired inputs to the model. Data visualization techniques, namely, chord diagrams and map plots, are used to visualize pre-processed data (corresponding to the years 2014 to 2020) and predicted data by the relatively best regression model for the year 2022. For the chosen data, it is concluded that Random Forest Regression (RFR), which predicts total IPC cognizable crime, fits relatively the best, with a 0.96 adjusted r squared value and a MAPE value of 0.2, and among regression models predicting region-wise theft crime count, the random forest regression-based model relatively fits the best, with an adjusted R squared value of 0.96 and a MAPE value of 0.166. These regression models predict that Andhra Pradesh state will have the highest crime counts, with Adilabad district at the top, having 31,933 predicted crime counts. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.","2024","2025-01-08 21:06:58","2025-01-08 21:06:58","","379-410","","1","11","","Ann.

However, there has been a major discrepancy between the way natural language processing (NLP) researchers model and annotate arguments in court decisions and the way legal experts understand and analyze legal argumentation. While computational approaches typically simplify arguments into generic premises and claims, arguments in legal research usually exhibit a rich typology that is important for gaining insights into the particular case and applications of law in general. We address this problem and make several substantial contributions to move the field forward. First, we design a new annotation scheme for legal arguments in proceedings of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) that is deeply rooted in the theory and practice of legal argumentation research. Second, we compile and annotate a large corpus of 373 court decisions (2.3M tokens and 15k annotated argument spans). Finally, we train an argument mining model that outperforms state-of-the-art models in the legal NLP domain and provide a thorough expert-based evaluation.

The advancement of natural language processing opens new avenues for bridging this legal literacy gap through the development of automated legal aid systems. However, existing legal question answering (LQA) approaches often suffer from a narrow scope, being either confined to specific legal domains or limited to brief, uninformative responses. In this work, we propose an end-to-end methodology designed to generate long-form answers to any statutory law questions, utilizing a ""retrieve-then-read"" pipeline. To support this approach, we introduce and release the Long-form Legal Question Answering (LLeQA) dataset, comprising 1,868 expert-annotated legal questions in the French language, complete with detailed answers rooted in pertinent legal provisions. Our experimental results demonstrate promising performance on automatic evaluation metrics, but a qualitative analysis uncovers areas for refinement. As one of the only comprehensive, expertannotated long-form LQA dataset, LLeQA has the potential to not only accelerate research towards resolving a significant real-world issue, but also act as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating NLP models in specialized domains.

Their analysis, which is at the center of legal practice, becomes increasingly elaborate as these collections grow in size. Natural language understanding (NLU) technologies can be a valuable tool to support legal practitioners in these endeavors. Their usefulness, however, largely depends on whether current state-of-the-art models can generalize across various tasks in the legal domain. To answer this currently open question, we introduce the Legal General Language Understanding Evaluation (LexGLUE) benchmark, a collection of datasets for evaluating model performance across a diverse set of legal NLU tasks in a standardized way.

With an average accuracy of 75% in predicting the violation of 9 articles of the European Convention on Human Rights our (relatively simple) approach highlights the potential of machine learning approaches in the legal domain.

We propose a semantic type taxonomy for norms in the German civil law domain consisting of nine different types focusing on functional aspects, such as Duties, Prohibitions, Permissions, etc. We performed four iterations in classifying legal norms with a rule-based approach using a manually labeled dataset, i.e., tenancy law, of the German Civil Code (n = 601). During this experiment the F                             1                              score continuously improved from 0.52 to 0.78. In contrast, a machine learning based approach for the classification was implemented. A performance of F                             1                             = 0.83 was reached. Traditionally, machine learning classifiers lack of transparency with regard to their decisions. We extended our approach using so-called local linear approximations, which is a novel technique to analyze and inspect a trained classifier’s behavior. We can show that there are significant similarities of manually crafted knowledge, i.e., rules and pattern definitions, and the trained decision structures of machine learning approaches.                          © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","2019-03","2025-01-08 21:07:18","2025-01-08 21:20:47","","43-71","","1","27","","Artif Intell Law","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","WOS:000464759800003","","","Number: 1 Publisher: Springer Netherlands","<p>Export Date: 18 December 2024; Cited By: 30; Correspondence Address: B.

Given the volume and availability of crime-related information present in online newspapers, gathering and integrating crime entities from multiple modalities and representing them as a knowledge base in machine-readable form will be useful for any law enforcement agencies to analyze and prevent criminal activities. Extant research works to generate the crime knowledge base, does not address extraction of all non-redundant entities from text and image data present in multiple newspapers. Hence, this work proposes Crime Base, an entity relationship based system to extract and integrate crime related text and image data from online newspapers with a focus towards reducing duplicity and loss of information in the knowledge base. The proposed system uses a rule-based approach to extract the entities from text and image captions. The entities extracted from text data are correlated using contextual as-well-as semantic similarity measures and image entities are correlated using low-level and high-level image features. The proposed system also presents an integrated view of these entities and their relations in the form of a knowledge base using OWL. The system is tested for a collection of crime related articles from popular Indian online newspapers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","2019-11-01","2025-01-08 21:07:25","2025-01-08 21:07:25","","102059","","6","56","","Information Processing & Management","Crime base","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","WOS:000487766200004","ScienceDirect","","Number: 6 Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Export Date: 18 December 2024; Cited By: 35; Correspondence Address: S.

We use two approaches-a single document untrained approach and a multi-document trained approach depending on the type of input case (criminal or civil).

In this paper, a dataset for named entity recognition in Brazilian legal documents is presented. Unlike other Portuguese language datasets, this dataset is composed entirely of legal documents. In addition to tags for persons, locations, time entities and organizations, the dataset contains specific tags for law and legal cases entities. To establish a set of baseline results, we first performed experiments on another Portuguese dataset: Paramopama. This evaluation demonstrate that LSTM-CRF gives results that are significantly better than those previously reported. We then retrained LSTM-CRF, on our dataset and obtained F 1 scores of 97.04% and 88.82% for Legislation and Legal case entities, respectively. These results show the viability of the proposed dataset for legal applications. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2018","2025-01-08 21:07:31","2025-01-08 21:20:38","","313-323","","","11122 LNAI","","","LeNER-Br","","","","","Springer Verlag","Cham","English","","","Scopus","WOS:000788007400032","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Identity theft is often a “gateway” crime, as criminals use stolen or fraudulent identities to steal money, claim eligibility for services, hack into networks without authorization, and so on. The available data describing identity crimes and their aftermath are often in the form of recorded stories and reports by the news press, fraud examiners, and law enforcement. All of these sources are unstructured. In order to analyze identity theft data, this research proposes an approach which involves the novel collection of online news stories and reports on the topic of identity theft. Our approach pre-processes the raw text and extracts semi-structured information automatically, using text mining techniques. This paper presents statistical analysis of behavioral patterns and resources used by thieves and fraudsters to commit identity theft, including the identity attributes commonly linked to identity crimes, resources thieves employ to conduct identity crimes, and temporal patterns of criminal behavior. Furthermore, the automatically extracted information is validated against manually investigated news stories. Analyses of these results increase empirical understanding of identity threat behaviors, offer early warning signs of identity theft, and thwart future identity theft crimes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","2017-03-01","2025-01-08 21:07:33","2025-01-08 21:07:33","","50-63","","5","58","","Computers & Security","Natural language processing in law","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","WOS:000677676500008","ScienceDirect","","Number: 5 Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Export Date: 18 December 2024; Cited By: 46; Correspondence Address: A.

We further demonstrate that it is feasible to automatically annotate sentences containing such legal facts and principles in a supervised machine learning framework based on linguistic features, reporting per category precision and recall figures of between 0.79 and 0.89 for classifying sentences in legal judgements as cited facts, principles or neither using a Bayesian classifier, with an overall κ of 0.72 with the human-annotated gold standard. © 2017, The Author(s).","2017","2025-01-08 21:07:42","2025-01-08 21:07:42","","107-126","","1","25","","Artif Intell Law","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Number: 1 Publisher: Springer Netherlands","<p>Export Date: 21 December 2024; Cited By: 57; Correspondence Address: A.

It offers a framework for improving maritime law and legal analytic policy-making procedures. The automation of legal document extraction takes center stage, underscoring the vital role sentiment analysis plays at the document level. Therefore, this study introduces a novel strategy for sentiment analysis in Canadian maritime case law, combining sentiment case law approaches with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The overarching goal is to systematically unearth hidden biases within case law and investigate their impact on legal outcomes. Employing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)- and long short-term memory (LSTM)-based models, this research achieves a remarkable accuracy of 98.05% for categorizing instances. In contrast, conventional machine learning techniques such as support vector machine (SVM) yield an accuracy rate of 52.57%, naïve Bayes at 57.44%, and logistic regression at 61.86%. The superior accuracy of the CNN and LSTM model combination underscores its usefulness in legal sentiment analysis, offering promising future applications in diverse fields like legal analytics and policy design.

In this paper, we examine a notable yet understudied AI design process in the legal domain that took place over a decade ago, the impact of which still informs legal automation efforts today. Specifically, we examine the design and evaluation activities that took place from 2006 to 2011 within the Text REtrieval Conference's (TREC) Legal Track, a computational research venue hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technologies. The Legal Track of TREC is notable in the history of AI research and practice because it relied on a range of participatory approaches to facilitate the design and evaluation of new computational techniques-in this case, for automating attorney document review for civil litigation matters. Drawing on archival research and interviews with coordinators of the Legal Track of TREC, our analysis reveals how an interactive simulation methodology allowed computer scientists and lawyers to become co-designers and helped bridge the chasm between computational research and real-world, high-stakes litigation practice. In analyzing this case from the recent past, our aim is to empirically ground contemporary critiques of AI development and evaluation and the calls for greater participation as a means to address them.  © 2022 ACM.","2022","2025-01-08 21:07:52","2025-01-08 21:07:52","","","","CSCW1","6","","Proc.

The law, puzzlingly, has yielded few documented instances of substantial gains to domain pretraining in spite of the fact that legal language is widely seen to be unique. We hypothesize that these existing results stem from the fact that existing legal NLP tasks are too easy and fail to meet conditions for when domain pretraining can help. To address this, we first present CaseHOLD (Case <u>H</u>oldings <u>O</u>n <u>L</u>egal <u>D</u>ecisions), a new dataset comprised of over 53,000+ multiple choice questions to identify the relevant holding of a cited case. This dataset presents a fundamental task to lawyers and is both legally meaningful and difficult from an NLP perspective (F1 of 0.4 with a BiLSTM baseline). Second, we assess performance gains on CaseHOLD and existing legal NLP datasets. While a Transformer architecture (BERT) pretrained on a general corpus (Google Books and Wikipedia) improves performance, domain pretraining (on a corpus of 3.5M decisions across all courts in the U.S. that is larger than BERT's) with a custom legal vocabulary exhibits the most substantial performance gains with CaseHOLD (gain of 7.2% on F1, representing a 12% improvement on BERT) and consistent performance gains across two other legal tasks. Third, we show that domain pretraining may be warranted when the task exhibits sufficient similarity to the pretraining corpus: the level of performance increase in three legal tasks was directly tied to the domain specificity of the task.

Focusing on the law article retrieval task, we present a deep learning framework named LamBERTa, which is designed for civil-law codes, and specifically trained on the Italian civil code. To our knowledge, this is the first study proposing an advanced approach to law article prediction for the Italian legal system based on a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) learning framework, which has recently attracted increased attention among deep learning approaches, showing outstanding effectiveness in several natural language processing and learning tasks. We define LamBERTa models by fine-tuning an Italian pre-trained BERT on the Italian civil code or its portions, for law article retrieval as a classification task. One key aspect of our LamBERTa framework is that we conceived it to address an extreme classification scenario, which is characterized by a high number of classes, the few-shot learning problem, and the lack of test query benchmarks for Italian legal prediction tasks. To solve such issues, we define different methods for the unsupervised labeling of the law articles, which can in principle be applied to any law article code system. We provide insights into the explainability and interpretability of our LamBERTa models, and we present an extensive experimental analysis over query sets of different type, for single-label as well as multi-label evaluation tasks. Empirical evidence has shown the effectiveness of LamBERTa, and also its superiority against widely used deep-learning text classifiers and a few-shot learner conceived for an attribute-aware prediction task. © 2021, The Author(s).","2022-09","2025-01-08 21:07:58","2025-01-08 21:21:15","","417-473","","3","30","","Artif Intell Law","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","WOS:000696120000001","","","Number: 3 Publisher: Institute for Ionics","<p>Export Date: 18 December 2024; Cited By: 30; Correspondence Address: A.

Methods: We conducted an intensive literature search on current or emerging AI and autonomous technologies (eg, vehicles), military and medical technologies (eg, surgical robots), relevant frameworks and standards, cyber security/safety- and legal-systems worldwide. We provide a discussion on unique challenges for robotic surgery faced by proposals made for AI more generally (eg, Explainable AI) and machine learning more specifically (eg, black box), as well as recommendations for developing and improving relevant frameworks or standards. Conclusion: We classify responsibility into the following: (1) Accountability; (2) Liability; and (3) Culpability. All three aspects were addressed when discussing responsibility for AI and autonomous surgical robots, be these civil or military patients (however, these aspects may require revision in cases where robots become citizens). The component which produces the least clarity is Culpability, since it is unthinkable in the current state of technology. We envision that in the near future a surgical robot can learn and perform routine operative tasks that can then be supervised by a human surgeon. This represents a surgical parallel to autonomously driven vehicles. Here a human remains in the ‘driving seat’ as a ‘doctor-in-the-loop’ thereby safeguarding patients undergoing operations that are supported by surgical machines with autonomous capabilities. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2019-02","2025-01-08 21:08:05","2025-01-08 21:08:05","","","","1","15","","Int.

Thus we propose a systematic investigation of the available strategies when applying BERT in specialised domains. These are: (a) use the original BERT out of the box, (b) adapt BERT by additional pre-training on domain-specific corpora, and (c) pre-train BERT from scratch on domain-specific corpora.

As one of the most crucial tasks of legal text mining, Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to automatically predict judgment results (e.g., applicable law articles, charges, and terms of penalty) according to fact descriptions on law cases and becomes a promising application of artificial intelligence techniques. Unfortunately, ambiguous fact descriptions and law articles often appear due to a great number of shared words and legal concepts. Prior works are proposed to partially address these problems, focusing on introducing additional attributes to distinguish similar fact descriptions, or differentiating confusing law articles by grouping and distilling law articles. However, existing works still face two severe challenges: (1) indistinguishable fact descriptions with different criminals and targets and (2) misleading law articles with highly similar TF–IDF representations, both of which lead to serious misjudgments for the LJP task. In this paper, we present a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based framework, named Criminal Element Extraction Network (CEEN), to handle above challenges simultaneously. In CEEN, we propose four types of discriminative criminal elements, including the criminal, target, intentionality, and criminal behavior. To discriminate ambiguous fact descriptions, an reinforcement learning based extractor is designed to accurately locate elements for different cases. To enhance law article predictions, distinctive element representations are constructed for each type of criminal element. Finally, with the input of element representations, a multi-task predictor is adopted for the judgment predictions. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that extracting criminal elements is highly useful for predicting the judgment results. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2022-01-01","2025-01-08 21:08:10","2025-01-08 21:19:03","","102780","","1","59","","Information Processing & Management","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","WOS:000718047300001","ScienceDirect","","Number: 1 Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Export Date: 18 December 2024; Cited By: 40; Correspondence Address: Z.

For this purpose, a dataset consisting of German court decisions was developed. The source texts were manually annotated with 19 semantic classes: person, judge, lawyer, country, city, street, landscape, organization, company, institution, court, brand, law, ordinance, European legal norm, regulation, contract, court decision, and legal literature. The dataset consists of approx. 67,000 sentences and contains 54,000 annotated entities. The 19 fine-grained classes were automatically generalised to seven more coarse-grained classes (person, location, organization, legal norm, case-by-case regulation, court decision, and legal literature). Thus, the dataset includes two annotation variants, i.e., coarse- and fine-grained. For the task of NER, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory Networks (BiLSTMs) were applied to the dataset as state of the art models. Three different models were developed for each of these two model families and tested with the coarse- and fine-grained annotations. The BiLSTM models achieve the best performance with an 95.46 F1 score for the fine-grained classes and 95.95 for the coarse-grained ones. The CRF models reach a maximum of 93.23 for the fine-grained classes and 93.22 for the coarse-grained ones.

While data or information are not subject matter within copyright law, almost all materials used to construct corpora for machine learning are protected by copyright law: texts, images, videos, and so on. There are global policy moves to address the copyright implications of machine learning, in particular in the context of so-called “foundation models” that underpin generative AI. This paper takes a step back, exploring empirically three technological settings through detailed case studies. We set out the established industry methodology of a lifecycle of AI (collecting data, organising data, model training, model operation) to arrive at descriptions suitable for legal analysis. This will allow an assessment of the challenges for a harmonisation of rights, exceptions and disclosure under EU copyright law. The three case studies are: Machine learning for scientific purposes, in the context of a study of regional short-term letting markets; Natural Language Processing (NLP), in the context of large language models; Computer vision, in the context of content moderation of images. We find that the nature and quality of data corpora at the input stage is central to the lifecycle of machine learning. Because of the uncertain legal status of data collection and processing, combined with the competitive advantage gained by firms not disclosing technological advances, the inputs of the models deployed are often unknown. Moreover, the “lawful access” requirement of the EU exception for text and data mining may turn the exception into a decision by rightholders to allow machine learning in the context of their decision to allow access. We assess policy interventions at EU level, seeking to clarify the legal status of input data via copyright exceptions, opt-outs or the forced disclosure of copyright materials. We find that the likely result is a fully copyright-licensed environment of machine learning that may have problematic effects for the structure of industry, innovation and scientific research. © The Author(s) 2024.","2024-01","2025-01-08 21:08:17","2025-01-08 21:17:13","","110-138","","1","55","","IIC Int.

However, implementing AI in administrative procedures requires a comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities and limitations of different systems, including considerations of transparency and data availability. Data are a crucial factor in the operation of AI systems and the validity of their predictions. It is essential to ensure that the data used to train AI algorithms are extensive, representative, and free of bias. Transparency is also an important aspect establishing trust and reliability in AI systems, particularly regarding the potential for transparent representation in rule-based and machine-learning AI systems. This paper examines the potential and challenges that arise from integrating AI into administrative procedures. In addition, the paper offers a nuanced perspective on current developments in artificial intelligence and provides a conceptual framework for its potential applications in administrative procedures. Beyond this, the paper highlights essential framework conditions that require continuous monitoring to ensure optimal results in practice. © The Author(s) 2023.","2024-06","2025-01-08 21:08:20","2025-01-08 21:08:20","","8390-8415","","2","15","","J.

It is of interest to study the wide variety of legal systems that have so far not received any attention. In particular, for the legal system of the Republic of Turkey, codified in Turkish, no works have been published. We first review the state-of-the-art of NLP in law, and then study the problem of predicting verdicts for several different courts, using several different algorithms. This study is much broader than earlier studies in the number of different courts and the variety of algorithms it includes. Therefore it provides a reference point and baseline for further studies in this area. We further hope the scope and systematic nature of this study can set a framework that can be applied to the study of other legal systems. We present novel results on predicting the rulings of the Turkish Constitutional Court and Courts of Appeal, using only fact descriptions, and without seeing the actual rulings. The methods that are utilized are based on Decision Trees (DTs), Random Forests (RFs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) methods; specifically Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs), with the integration of an attention mechanism for each model. The prediction results for all algorithms are given in a comparative and detailed manner. We demonstrate that outcomes of the courts of Turkish legal system can be predicted with high accuracy, especially with deep learning based methods. The presented results exhibit similar performance to earlier work in the literature for other languages and legal systems.","2021-09-01","2025-01-08 21:08:29","2025-01-08 21:20:41","2025-01-02 19:45:32","102684","","5","58","","Information Processing & Management","Natural language processing in law","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Number: 5","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;30<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;34<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;75</p>","C:\Users\jesus\Desktop\PortableApps\PortableApps\ZoteroPortable\Data\profile\storage\6XW4FLT8\Mumcuoğlu et al. - 2021 - Natural language processing in law Prediction of outcomes in the higher courts of Turkey.pdf; C:\Users\jesus\Desktop\PortableApps\PortableApps\ZoteroPortable\Data\profile\storage\SXBFGQA4\S0306457321001692.html","","Law; Natural language processing; Machine learning; Deep learning; MODELS; NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION; AI in law; LEGAL; Legal text mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we propose an approach and tool support for automated detection and resolution of cross references. The approach leverages the structure of legal texts, formalized into a schema, and a set of natural language patterns for legal cross reference expressions. These patterns were developed based on an investigation of Luxembourg's legislation, written in French. To build confidence about their applicability beyond the context where they were observed, these patterns were validated against the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) by the Government of Ontario, Canada, written in both French and English.

Hardly any attempt has been made to predict the outcome of German cases, although prior court decisions become more and more important in various legal domains of Germany's jurisdiction, e.g., tax law. This paper summarizes our research on training a machine learning classifier to determine likelihood ratios and thus predict the outcome of a restricted set of cases from Germany's jurisdiction. Based on a data set of German tax law cases (44 285 documents from 1945 to 2016) we selected those cases which belong to an appeal decision (5 990 documents). We used the provided meta-data and natural language processing to extract 11 relevant features and trained a Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether an appeal is going to be successful or not. The evaluation (10-fold cross validation) on the data set has shown a performance regarding F-1-score between 0.53 and 0.58. This score indicates that there is room for improvement. We expect that the high relevancy for legal practice, the availability of data, and advance machine learning techniques will foster more research in this area.","2017","2025-01-08 21:11:04","2025-01-08 21:11:04","","89-99","","","10429","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000431902300008","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;5</p>","C:\Users\jesus\Desktop\PortableApps\PortableApps\ZoteroPortable\Data\profile\storage\LXKYGW55\Waltl et al. - 2017 - Predicting the Outcome of Appeal Decisions in Germany's Tax Law.pdf","","","","Parycek, P; Charalabidis, Y; Chugunov, AV; Panagiotopoulos, P; Pardo, TA; Saebo, O; Tambouris, E","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ELECTRONIC PARTICIPATION (EPART 2017)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, these regimes prescribe that companies will not use data for purposes other than the purposes for which they were collected, called use limitation, except for legal purposes and when the user provides consent. To help companies write better privacy requirements that embody the use limitations and collection limitation principles, we conducted a case study to identify how purpose is expressed among five privacy policies from the shopping domain. Using content analysis, we discovered six exclusive data purpose categories. In addition, we observed natural language patterns to express purpose. Finally, we found that data purpose specificity varies with the specificity of information type descriptions.

The classification of clauses or sentences enables valuable insights such as the extraction of rights and obligations. However, datasets consisting of contracts are quite rare, particularly regarding German language. Therefore this paper experiments the portability of machine learning (ML) models with regard to different document types. We trained different ML classifiers on the tenancy law of the German Civil Code (BGB) to apply the resulting models on a set of rental agreements afterwards. The performance of our models varies on the contract set. Some models perform significantly worse, while certain settings reveal a portability. Additionally, we trained and evaluated the same classifiers on a dataset consisting solely of contracts, to be able to observe a reference performance. We could show that the performance of ML models may depend on the document type used for training, while certain setups result in portable models.","2018","2025-01-08 21:11:10","2025-01-08 21:11:10","","61-70","","","313","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000455955300007","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;17</p>","C:\Users\jesus\Desktop\PortableApps\PortableApps\ZoteroPortable\Data\profile\storage\YQJH4XL6\Glaser et al. - 2018 - Classifying Semantic Types of Legal Sentences Portability of Machine Learning Models.pdf","","CLASSIFICATION; natural language processing; text mining; legal sentence classification; portability of machine learning models","","Palmirani, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LEGAL KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS (JURIX 2018)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article provides an overview of how computational methods are affecting research across the varied landscape of legal scholarship, from the interpretation of legal texts to the quantitative estimation of causal factors that shape the law. As computational tools continue to penetrate legal scholarship, they allow scholars to gain traction on traditional research questions and may engender entirely new research programs. Already, computational methods have facilitated important contributions in a diverse array of law-related research areas. As these tools continue to advance, and law scholars become more familiar with their potential applications, the impact of computational methods is likely to continue to grow.","2020","2025-01-08 21:11:28","2025-01-08 21:11:28","","39-57","","","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000590408800003","","","DOI: 10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-052720-121843","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;33<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;36<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;150</p>","C:\Users\jesus\Desktop\PortableApps\PortableApps\ZoteroPortable\Data\profile\storage\KUVWE524\Frankenreiter e Livermore - 2020 - Computational Methods in Legal Analysis.pdf","","machine learning; LAW; big data; BIAS; CITATIONS; NETWORK ANALYSIS; COMPLEXITY; computational law; digital humanities; empirical legal studies; EUROPEAN COURT; INNOVATION; legal history; PRECEDENT; RULES; SUPREME-COURT OPINIONS","","MacCoun, RJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Naturally, these labels are entangled among different tasks and within a task. For example, each charge is only logically or semantically related to some fixed articles. Ignoring these constraints, LJP methods would predict unreliable results. To solve this problem, we first formalize LJP as a node classification problem over a global consistency graph derived from the training set. In terms of node encoder, we utilize a masked transformer network to obtain case aware node representations consistent among tasks and discriminative within a task. In terms of node classifier, each node's label distribution is dependent on its neighbors' in this graph to achieve local consistency by relational learning. Both the node encoder and classifier are optimized by variational EM. Finally, we propose a novel measure to evaluate self-consistency of classification results. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the F1 improvement of our method is about 4.8% compared with SOTA methods.","2021-07-11","2025-01-08 21:11:34","2025-01-08 21:11:34","","983-992","","","","","","","SIGIR '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","English","","","","WOS:000719807900096","ACM Digital Library","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;24<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;25<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;33</p>","C:\Users\jesus\Desktop\PortableApps\PortableApps\ZoteroPortable\Data\profile\storage\ZSATK6DR\Dong e Niu - 2021 - Legal Judgment Prediction via Relational Learning.pdf","","Natural Language Processing; Legal Judgement Prediction; Statistical Relational Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SIGIR '21 - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 44TH INTERNATIONAL ACM SIGIR CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We consider a variety of approaches, including dynamic few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and zero-shot prompting. While we achieve results with GPT-3 that are better than the previous best published results, we also identify several types of clear errors it makes. We investigate why these errors happen. We discover that GPT-3 has imperfect prior knowledge of the actual U.S. statutes on which SARA is based. More importantly, we create simple synthetic statutes, which GPT-3 is guaranteed not to have seen during training. We find GPT-3 performs poorly at answering straightforward questions about these simple synthetic statutes.","2023","2025-01-08 21:12:13","2025-01-08 21:12:13","","22-31","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001139079400003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;27</p>","C:\Users\jesus\Desktop\PortableApps\PortableApps\ZoteroPortable\Data\profile\storage\5VXYFXYX\Blair-Stanek et al. - 2023 - Can GPT-3 Perform Statutory Reasoning.pdf","","law; natural language processing; GPT-3; reasoning; statutes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PROCEEDINGS OF THE 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW, ICAIL 2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"VKH5NW98","journalArticle","2024","Choi, JH","Measuring Clarity in Legal Text","UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO LAW REVIEW","","0041-9494","","","Legal cases often turn on judgments of textual clarity: when the text is unclear, judges allow extrinsic evidence in contract disputes, consult legislative history in statutory interpretation, and more. Despite this, almost no empirical work considers the nature or prevalence of legal clarity. Scholars and judges who study real-world documents to inform the interpretation of legal text primarily treat unclear text as a research problem to be solved with more data rather than a fundamental feature of language.This Article makes both theoretical and empirical contributions to the legal concept of textual clarity. It first advances a theory of clarity that distinguishes between information and determinacy. A judge might find text unclear because she personally lacks sufficient information to decide which interpretation is best; alternatively, she might find it unclear because the text itself is fundamentally indeterminate. Fundamental linguistic indeterminacy explains ongoing interpretive debates and limits the potential for text-focused methods (including corpus linguistics) to decide cases.With this theoretical background, the Article then proposes a new method to algorithmically evaluate textual clarity. Applying techniques from natural language processing and artificial intelligence that measure the semantic similarity between words, we can shed valuable new light on questions of legal interpretation.This Article finds that text is frequently indeterminate in real-world legal cases. Moreover, estimates of similarity vary substantially from corpus to corpus, even for large and reputable corpora. This suggests that word use is highly corpus specific and that meaning can vary even between general-purpose corpora that theoretically capture ordinary meaning.These empirical findings have important implications for ongoing doctrinal debates, suggesting that text is less clear and objective than many textualists believe. Ultimately, the Article offers new insights both to theorists considering the role of legal text and to empiricists seeking to understand how text is used in the real world.","2024-01","2025-01-08 21:12:32","2025-01-08 21:12:32","","1-82","","1","91","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001140085100003","","","Number: 1","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;127</p>","C:\Users\jesus\Desktop\PortableApps\PortableApps\ZoteroPortable\Data\profile\storage\E8RUM9DK\Choi - Measuring Clarity in Legal Text.pdf","","LAW; CONSENSUS; CONTRACT INTERPRETATION; CORPUS; DELEGATION; STATUTORY INTERPRETATION; TEXTUALISM; VAGUENESS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper begins by investigating the methodological challenges in documenting and verifying the 90th-percentile claim, presenting four sets of findings that indicate that OpenAI's estimates of GPT-4's UBE percentile are overinflated. First, although GPT-4's UBE score nears the 90th percentile when examining approximate conversions from February administrations of the Illinois Bar Exam, these estimates are heavily skewed towards repeat test-takers who failed the July administration and score significantly lower than the general test-taking population. Second, data from a recent July administration of the same exam suggests GPT-4's overall UBE percentile was below the 69th percentile, and similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 48th percentile on essays. Third, examining official NCBE data and using several conservative statistical assumptions, GPT-4's performance against first-time test takers is estimated to be similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 62nd percentile, including similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 42nd percentile on essays. Fourth, when examining only those who passed the exam (i.e. licensed or license-pending attorneys), GPT-4's performance is estimated to drop to similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 48th percentile overall, and similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 15th percentile on essays. In addition to investigating the validity of the percentile claim, the paper also investigates the validity of GPT-4's reported scaled UBE score of 298. The paper successfully replicates the MBE score, but highlights several methodological issues in the grading of the MPT + MEE components of the exam, which call into question the validity of the reported essay score. Finally, the paper investigates the effect of different hyperparameter combinations on GPT-4's MBE performance, finding no significant effect of adjusting temperature settings, and a significant effect of few-shot chain-of-thought prompting over basic zero-shot prompting. Taken together, these findings carry timely insights for the desirability and feasibility of outsourcing legally relevant tasks to AI models, as well as for the importance for AI developers to implement rigorous and transparent capabilities evaluations to help secure safe and trustworthy AI.","2024-03-30","2025-01-08 21:12:42","2025-01-08 21:30:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001194581100001","","","","<p>Export Date: 18 December 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: E.

This will force data controllers to go beyond the traditional focus on data quality and security, and consider the impact of data processing on fundamental rights and collective social and ethical values. Building on studies of the collective dimension of data protection, this article sets out to embed this new perspective in an assessment model centred on human rights (Human Rights, Ethical and Social Impact Assessment-HRESIA). This self-assessment model intends to overcome the limitations of the existing assessment models, which are either too closely focused on data processing or have an extent and granularity that make them too complicated to evaluate the consequences of a given use of data. In terms of architecture, the HRESIA has two main elements: a self-assessment questionnaire and an ad hoc expert committee. As a blueprint, this contribution focuses mainly on the nature of the proposed model, its architecture and its challenges; a more detailed description of the model and the content of the questionnaire will be discussed in a future publication drawing on the ongoing research.

The ultimate goal is to support legal decision-making with automation. The legal domain is a challenging one to tackle. However, current advances in analytic technologies and models hold the promise of success. Our application of Hadoop MapReduce in conjunction with a number of algorithms, such as clustering, classification, word count, word co-occurrence, and row similarity, is encouraging, in that the results are robust enough to suggest these approaches have promise and are worth pursuing. By utilizing larger case data sets and sample sizes and by using deep machine learning models in text analytics, more breakthroughs can be achieved to provide decision support to the legal domain.

The increased adoption of AI, affecting so many aspects of our daily lives, highlights the potential risks around automated decision making and the need for better governance and ethical standards when deploying such systems. In response to that need, governments, states, municipalities, private sector organizations, and industry groups around the world have drafted hundreds, perhaps even thousands at this point - of new, regulatory proposals and guidelines; many already in effect and more on the way. The data-driven and often black box nature of these systems does not absolve organizations from the social responsibility or increasingly commonplace regulatory requirements to confirm they work as intended and are deployed in a responsible manner, lest they run the risk of reputational damage, regulatory fines, and/or legal action.

Based on this observation, this article investigates the logic underlined in judicial trials and the technical characteristics of AI, and proposes an AI-based semantic assist approach for judicial trials that is logical and transparent to the judges.","2020-11","2025-01-08 21:13:55","2025-01-08 21:13:55","","531-540","","3","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000641479000008","","","Number: 3","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;43</p>","C:\Users\jesus\Desktop\PortableApps\PortableApps\ZoteroPortable\Data\profile\storage\882SRV73\Jin e He - 2020 - An Artificial-Intelligence-Based Semantic Assist Framework for Judicial Trials.pdf","","artificial intelligence; fact extraction and verification; legal reason; semantic similarity; sentencing prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In considering its future direction, this article contemplates various perspectives regarding the purpose of legal education, and the pressures that may be brought to bear on pedagogical practices as a result of current and emerging technologies. Situating these considerations within the broader commentary regarding the future of work and the role of human beings in an age of automation, this article argues that the nature and type of skills taught to future lawyers, as well as the substantive knowledge relevant in the 21st century, will depend upon the irreducible value of human beings to the law and legal processes. Tasks that require creativity, complex reasoning or social intelligence (such as the ability to negotiate complex social relationships effectively) will remain the province of human beings. This must inform and shape legal education. Consequently, this article argues that the future of legal education is one that recognises lawyers will increasingly be required to attain a broad, liberal education enabling interdisciplinary insights, creativity and social intelligence.","2020","2025-01-08 21:13:56","2025-01-08 21:13:56","","243-265","","1","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000558661200008","","","Number: 1","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;83</p>","C:\Users\jesus\Desktop\PortableApps\PortableApps\ZoteroPortable\Data\profile\storage\W9W2C94V\Goldsworthy - THE FUTURE OF LEGAL EDUCATION.pdf","","AGE; MOOCS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A model is developed to explain how AI-based systems combine with humans to do work, both automating and augmenting the work of the professional, leading to process improvement and extension of the service offering. The study uses case-based research in two law firms and two accountancy firms using AI-based systems. It shows that AI-based systems are used selectively, mainly on high-volume, back-office tasks, across the sequence of stages in the professional service process-diagnosis, inference, and treatment. Automation using AI relieves professionals from repetitive tasks, while AI achieves augmentation by buffering professionals from low-value activity, making their expertise scalable and providing new analytical insights. System use can improve performance in delivering core professional services and enable service extension into additional, high-value advisory work.

In a 2x2 between-subject experiment, we test how model accuracy (high vs. low) and type of explanation (human-like vs. not) affect trust in AI over time. We study a complex decision-making task in which individuals estimate jail time for 20 criminal law cases with AI advice. Results show that trust is significantly higher for high-accuracy models. Also, behavioral trust does not decline, and subjective trust even increases significantly with high accuracy.

While smart contracts offer efficiency and security, their automation introduces significant legal challenges. Detecting and preventing fraud is a primary concern. This paper proposes a novel application of artificial intelligence (AI) to address these challenges. We will develop a machine learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to effectively detect and mitigate fraudulent activities within smart contracts. The AI model will analyze both textual and transactional data from smart contracts to identify patterns indicative of fraud. This approach not only enhances the security of digital transactions on blockchain platforms but also informs the development of legal standards and regulatory frameworks necessary for governing these technologies. By training on a dataset of authentic and fraudulent contract examples, the proposed AI model is expected to offer high predictive accuracy, thereby supporting legal practitioners and regulators in real-time monitoring and enforcement. The ultimate goal of this project is to contribute to legal scholarship by providing a robust technological tool that aids in preventing cybercrimes associated with smart contracts, thereby laying a foundation for future legal research and development at the intersection of law, technology, and security.","2024-09","2025-01-08 21:14:32","2025-01-08 21:14:32","","2139-2156","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001323083000001","","","Number: 3","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;68</p>","C:\Users\jesus\Desktop\PortableApps\PortableApps\ZoteroPortable\Data\profile\storage\9CIGD24Z\Louati et al. - 2024 - Adopting Artificial Intelligence to Strengthen Legal Safeguards in Blockchain Smart Contracts A Str.pdf","","EVOLUTION; ARCHITECTURES; AI fraud detection in blockchain; legal aspects of artificial intelligence; smart contract enforcement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the federal government of the United States has largely sidestepped the issue of crafting law dictating limitations and expectations regarding the use of AI technology, US state legislatures have begun to take the lead in this area. Nonetheless, we know very little about how state legislatures have approached the design, pursuit, and adoption of AI policy and whether traditional political fault lines have manifested themselves in the AI issue area. Here, we gather data on the state-level adoption of AI policy, as well as roll call voting on AI bills (classified on the basis of consumer protection versus economic development), by state legislatures and analyze the political economy of AI legislation. We find that rising unemployment and inflation are negatively associated with a state's AI policymaking. With respect to individual legislator support, we find that liberal lawmakers and Democrats are more likely to support bills establishing consumer protection requirements on AI usage. The results suggest that economic concerns loom large with AI and that traditional political fault lines may be establishing themselves in this area.","2024-06","2025-01-08 21:14:37","2025-01-08 21:14:37","","240-262","","2","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001192295900001","","","Number: 2","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;33</p>","C:\Users\jesus\Desktop\PortableApps\PortableApps\ZoteroPortable\Data\profile\storage\S96UAU4A\Parinandi et al. - 2024 - Investigating the politics and content of US State artificial intelligence legislation.pdf","","AI; FUTURE; AUTOMATION; DURATION MODELS; federalism; JOBS; legislative politics; public policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the general domain, entities and relations are mostly words and phrases, indicating that they do not span multiple sentences. In contrast, evidence information in CRDs may span multiple sentences, while existing models cannot handle this situation. To address this issue, we first add a classification task in addition to the extraction task. We then formulate the two tasks as a multi-task learning problem and present a novel end-to-end model to jointly address the two tasks. The joint model adopts a shared encoder followed by separate decoders for the two tasks.
