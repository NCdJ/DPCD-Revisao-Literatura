        <dc:title>&quot;It's Like I've Got This Music in My Mind&quot;:1 Protecting Human Authorship in the Age of Generative Artificial Intelligence</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The music industry stands on the brink of a crisis. With unpredictable judicial standards that are inconsistent across the country, plaintiffs seeking to protect their musical works against copyright infringement face a heavy burden of proof, especially when facing defendants who are more wellknown and more well-funded. Not only that, but plaintiffs may not receive their day in court given that powerhouse artists like Taylor Swift, Sam Smith, and Bruno Mars have chosen to settle rather than defend their musical works in court. Now, Generative Artificial Intelligence (&quot;Generative A.I.&quot;) and A.I.-generated music will inevitably send the music industry into a tailspin-and the law is not ready to grapple with the complexities that will arise. To wit, Generative A.I. is poised to threaten the very principles on which copyright law is founded: To encourage (human) creativity by protecting original works of expression. This Note seeks to protect human music copyright holders against the ever-growing threat of A.I.-generated music. Part I addresses A.I. technology and the legal uncertainties associated with A.I.-generated music. Part II discusses the current doctrine of music copyright infringement. Part III offers a series of proposals for how to adapt the current doctrine to ensure music copyright holders can protect their original works of human authorship against A.I.-generated works.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>THE DAWN OF AI GENERATED CONTENTS: REVISITING COMPULSORY MEDIATION AND IP DISPUTES RESOLUTION</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>With the popularity of generative artificial intelligence (hereinafter &quot;AI&quot;), current intellectual property laws are being greatly challenged and the established doctrines redefined. As different jurisdictions are in the process of &quot;catching up&quot; to the technology, this paper argues that compulsory mediation, as an alternate dispute resolution, has the potential to address legal uncertainties. The flexible and informal nature of the compulsory mediation process makes a suitable environment for all stakeholders involved, the right owners, the creators, and the users of the AI, to come to an agreement, thus lessening the impact such new invention brings to domestic legal framework. Moreover, by looking into compulsory mediations in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Turkey, this paper hopes to outline key factors for compulsory mediation to properly tackle the subject of intellectual property disputes of AI nature.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>LEGAL ANALYSIS OF EU ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ACT (2024): INSIGHTS FROM PERSONAL DATA GOVERNANCE AND HEALTH POLICY</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Background: This study correlates the up-to-date ethical, functional and legal evaluations related to the management and governance of artificial intelligence (AI) under European Union (EU) law, particularly impacting the health data sector and medical standards as provided by the Artificial Intelligence Act within the Regulation adopted by the European Council in May 2024. The initial proposal for the management and governance of the AI sector was submitted in April 2021. Three years later, on 13 March 2024, the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AIA) was adopted by the European Parliament. Subsequently, on 21 May 2024, the Council adopted an innovative legislative framework that harmonises the standards and rules for AI regulation. This framework is set to take effect in May 2026, with the central objective of stimulating and motivating a fair, safe, legal single market that respects the principles of ethics and the fundamental rights of the human person. Methods: The current legal analysis focuses on the European Unions' new institutional governance involving a multistage approach to managing health data, ethical artificial intelligence, generative artificial intelligence and classification of types of AI by considering the degree of risk (e.g. artificial intelligence systems with limited risk and systems with high risk) and medical devices. It outlines the legal framework for AI regulation and governance in the EU by focusing on compliance with the previously adopted legislation in the Medical Devices Regulation (2017) and the In-Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (2017). The paper also examines the application of the newly adopted EU Artificial Intelligence Act in relation to national justice systems, previous EU regulations on medical devices and personal data protection regulation, and its correlation with the European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence. This opens up complex discussions related to judicial reform and access to justice. For this purpose, as a research objective, the legal analysis includes an innovative perspective following an integrative discussion on the latest legal reforms and regulations of the AI sector in Eastern Europe launched in 2024 with a special focus on the latest developments in the EU Candidate Countries namely Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova. Results and conclusions: The present research facilitates the exploration of the real benefits of managing innovative AI systems for medical data, research, and development, as well as within the medical technology industry.</dcterms:abstract>
