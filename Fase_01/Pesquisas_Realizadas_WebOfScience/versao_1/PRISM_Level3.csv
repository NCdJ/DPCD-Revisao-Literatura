In this short paper, we present a Recurrent Neural Network implementation using LSTM to classify entities such as class, subject, value, individuals, among others items, in lawsuits. The initial dataset focused on a sample of 100 thousand lawsuits of Sao Paulo state court, in Brazil. The proposed method achieved an accuracy and F1-score of approximately 90% in the tested data. Such preliminary results indicate that it is possible to create a model capable of generalizing such classifications on a large scale even regarding the specifics of Brazilian legal texts terminology.","2021","2024-11-03 18:11:27","2024-11-03 18:11:27","","648-656","","","12950","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000722379800048","","","","","","","Natural Language Processing; Legal documents; Named entity recognition","","Gervasi, O; Murgante, B; Misra, S; Garau, C; Blecic, I; Taniar, D; Apduhan, BO; Rocha, AMAC; Tarantino, E; Torre, CM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS, ICCSA 2021, PT II","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thanks to the self-attention component, these models have achieved significant improvements in text generation tasks (such as extractive and abstractive text summarization). However, research works involving text summarization and the legal domain are still in their infancy, and as such, benchmarks and a comparative analysis of these state of the art models is important for the future of text summarization of this highly specialized task. In order to contribute to these research works, the researchers propose a comparative analysis of different, fine-tuned Transformer models and datasets in order to provide a better understanding of the task at hand and the challenges ahead. The results show that Transformer models have improved upon the text summarization task, however, consistent and generalized learning is a challenge that still exists when training the models with large text dimensions. Finally, after analyzing the correlation between objective results and human opinion, the team concludes that the Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) [13] metrics used in the current state of the art are limited and do not reflect the precise quality of a generated summary.","2022","2024-11-03 18:11:27","2024-11-03 18:11:27","","372-386","","","1675","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000921196400028","","","","","","","Natural language processing; Deep learning; Transformers; Abstractive text summarization; Benchmark","","Guarda, T; Portela, F; Augusto, MF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ADVANCED RESEARCH IN TECHNOLOGIES, INFORMATION, INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY, ARTIIS 2022, PT I","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous approaches in representing a legal sentence often based on logical patterns that illustrate the relations between concepts in the sentence, often consist of multiple words. Those representations cause the lack of semantic information at the word level. In our work, we aim to tackle such shortcomings by representing legal texts in the form of abstract meaning representation (AMR), a graph-based semantic representation that gains lots of polarity in NLP community recently. We present our study in AMR Parsing (producing AMR from natural language) and AMR-to-text Generation (producing natural language from AMR) specifically for legal domain. We also introduce JCivilCode, a human-annotated legal AMR dataset which was created and verified by a group of linguistic and legal experts. We conduct an empirical evaluation of various approaches in parsing and generating AMR on our own dataset and show the current challenges. Based on our observation, we propose our domain adaptation method applying in the training phase and decoding phase of a neural AMR-to-text generation model. Our method improves the quality of text generated from AMR graph compared to the baseline model.

""Bots,"" automated expert systems, and predictive analytics are already changing the way consumers seek, and lawyers provide, legal services. Among other impacts, AI has the potential to increase access to justice in the self-help, individual, and corporate law firm markets by lowering costs and expanding services to untapped markets. A prominent question in early literature on AI in law is whether these services constitute the unauthorized practice of law. Threshold questions of whether and by whom such services should be regulated are important, but will likely not be answered (or even answerable) until AI's impact on the profession is more cognizable. In the meantime, there is currently no comprehensive guidance for attorneys on how AI should be developed, adopted, and used in ways that conform to a lawyer's ethical obligations. Without such guidance, law firms and third-party services risk designing and adopting AI-driven tools that fail to provide effective client-centered services, inhibit wide-spread access to justice, and undermine lawyers' ethical obligations to current and former clients, including the obligations to practice competently, maintain confidentiality, effectively supervise third parties, communicate with clients, and exercise independent judgment and render candid advice. This Article initiates this critical dialogue by exploring the types of AI being implemented in the profession, and identifying characteristics of these emerging services that will present ethical tensions and challenges. It rigorously examines existing guidance from the ABA and state bar authorities concerning new technology in practice, and identifies areas where this guidance is not sufficient to confront the unique ethical issues presented by AI. This article does not attempt to provide detailed or prescriptive guidance on these issues, but rather identifies the imminent challenges not currently being addressed in the literature on AI and legal ethics, or by bar authorities. The concluding recommendations will set the stage for and inform future scholarship and discussions concerning legal ethics, access to justice, and unauthorized practice of law in the age of AI.","2018-12","2024-11-03 18:12:08","2024-11-03 18:12:08","","173-212","","1","70","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000455216800004","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How should the law respond? A broad consensus suggests approaching the issue principally through the lens of indirect discrimination, focusing on algorithmic systems' impact. In this article, we set out to challenge this analysis, arguing that while indirect discrimination law has an important role to play, a narrow em on this regime in the context of machine learning algorithms is both normatively undesirable and legally flawed. We illustrate how certain forms of algorithmic bias in frequently deployed algorithms might constitute direct discrimination, and explore the ramifications-both in practical terms, and the broader challenges automated decision-making systems pose to the conceptual apparatus of anti-discrimination law.","2023-01","2024-11-03 18:12:25","2024-11-03 18:12:25","","144-175","","1","86","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000834063200001","","","","","","","FAIRNESS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While a large part of the research has been so far devoted to the extraction of purely legal information, less attention has been paid to seeking out in the texts the clues of more complex entities: legally relevant facts whose detection requires to link and interpret, as a unified whole, legal information and results of empirical analyses. This paper presents an ongoing research that points in this direction, trying to devise new ways to support public prosecutors in assessing the dangerousness of individuals and groups under investigation, an activity that precisely relies on the cross-sectional evaluation of legal and empirical data. A knowledge mining strategy will be outlined that lines up, into a single metaheuristic model, information extraction, network-based inference, machine learning and visual analytics. We will focus, in particular, on the integration of graph-based inference and machine learning methods used both to support classification tasks and to explore new forms of man-machine cooperation. Experiments made involving public prosecutors from the Italian Anti-Mafia Investigation Directorate and using data from real investigations have not only shown the potentialities of our approach but also offered an opportunity to reflect on the role we could assign to AI when thinking about the future of legal science and practice.","2023-12","2024-11-03 18:12:25","2024-11-03 18:12:25","","653-702","","4","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000870659500001","","","","","","","NETWORK ANALYSIS; LAW; CLASSIFICATION; ARGUMENTATION; CRIME; EXTRACTION; AUGMENTED INTELLIGENCE COLLABORATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The right to erasure in the GDPR gives, however, little clear guidance on how controllers processing personal data should erase the personal data to meet the requirements set out in Article 17. Machine Learning (ML) models that have been trained on personal data are downstream derivatives of the personal data used in the training data set of the ML process. A characteristic of ML is the non-deterministic nature of the learning process. The non-deterministic nature of ML poses significant difficulties in determining whether the personal data in the training data set affects the internal weights and adjusted parameters of the ML model. As a result, invoking the right to erasure in ML and to erase personal data from a ML model is a challenging task.This paper explores the complexities of enforcing and complying with the right to erasure in a ML context. It examines how novel developments in machine unlearning methods relate to Article 17 of the GDPR. Specifically, the paper delves into the intricacies of how personal data is processed in ML models and how the right to erasure could be implemented in such models. The paper also provides insights into how newly developed machine unlearning techniques could be applied to make ML models more GDPR compliant. The research aims to provide a functional understanding and contribute to a better comprehension of the applied challenges associated with the right to erasure in ML.(c) 2023 Bjorn Aslak Juliussen, Jon Petter Rui, Dag Johansen.
