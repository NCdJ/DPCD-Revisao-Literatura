Nevertheless, detecting sentence boundaries within legal texts poses a unique and challenging problem due to their distinct structural and linguistic features. Our approach utilizes deep learning models to leverage delimiter and surrounding context information as input, enabling precise detection of sentence boundaries in English legal texts. We evaluate various deep learning models, including domain-specific transformer models like LegalBERT and CaseLawBERT. To assess the efficacy of our deep learning models, we compare them with a state-of-the-art domain-specific statistical conditional random field (CRF) model. After considering model size, F1-score, and inference time, we identify the Convolutional Neural Network Model (CNN) as the top-performing deep learning model. To further enhance performance, we integrate the features of the CNN model into the subsequent CRF model, creating a hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of both models. Our experiments demonstrate that the hybrid model outperforms the baseline model, achieving a 4% improvement in the F1-score. Additional experiments showcase the superiority of the hybrid model over SBD open-source libraries when confronted with an out-of-domain test set. These findings underscore the importance of efficient SBD in legal texts and emphasize the advantages of employing deep learning models and hybrid architectures to achieve optimal performance.","2024-03-14","2024-11-03 16:32:30","2024-11-03 16:32:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001182938300001","","","","","","","Natural language processing; Deep learning; CaseLawBERT; CNN; CRF; LegalBERT; Sentence boundary detection; Transformer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in legal domains, due to the complexity, length, and sparsity of legal case documents, the use of these advanced NLP techniques has offered comparatively slight returns. Perhaps even more importantly, such methods are critically lacking in explainability and justification of outputs, which are essential for many legal applications. We propose that the direction of these NLP techniques should be aimed at ascription to a legal knowledge model, which can then provide the necessary and auditable justifications for the rationale of any case outcome. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of using Hierarchical Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (H-BERT) models to ascribe to an Angelic Domain Model (ADM) that is able to represent the legal knowledge of a domain in a structured way, enabling justifications and improving performance. Our study involved an annotation task on a popular domain, cases from the European Court of Human Rights, to gain an understanding of the balance of complaints in the domain. The data set produced from this study enabled training of models for factor ascription using the classification targets derived from the annotations. We present results of experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of the ascription task at three different levels of abstraction within the structured model.","2023","2024-11-03 16:32:30","2024-11-03 16:46:17","","167-176","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001139079400018","","","","","","","case annotation; domain model; factor ascription; Transformers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PROCEEDINGS OF THE 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW, ICAIL 2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Discussions of potential uses (e.g., document drafting, summarization) of this emerging technology in legal domain have intensified, but to date there has not been a rigorous analysis of these large language models' (LLM) capacity in sentence-level semantic annotation of legal texts in zero-shot learning settings. Yet, this particular type of use could unlock many practical applications (e.g., in contract review) and research opportunities (e.g., in empirical legal studies). We fill the gap with this study. We examined if and how successfully the model can semantically annotate small batches of short text snippets (10-50) based exclusively on concise definitions of the semantic types. We found that the GPT model performs surprisingly well in zero-shot settings on diverse types of documents (F-1 =.73 on a task involving court opinions, .86 for contracts, and .54 for statutes and regulations). These findings can be leveraged by legal scholars and practicing lawyers alike to guide their decisions in integrating LLMs in wide range of workflows involving semantic annotation of legal texts.","2023","2024-11-03 16:32:44","2024-11-03 16:32:44","","447-451","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001139079400053","","","","","","","adjudicatory; DECISIONS; EXTRACTION; generative pre-trained transformers; GPT; Semantic legal annotation; transfer learning; zero-shot","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PROCEEDINGS OF THE 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW, ICAIL 2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The incorporation of these tools can improve the analysis of the text of the proposed new laws and speed the preparation and discussion of new laws. The performance of artificial intelligence tools for text processing tasks is largely affected by the corpora used, which should ideally be adapted for the specific domain. When dealing with legislative corpora, text segmentation is often necessary due to the distinct purposes of legislative segments within the overall bill structure. While rule-based approaches can be effective in cases where the data follows a consistent format, they fail when inconsistencies arise in the formatting of legislative bills. In this study, we extensively investigate the use of weak supervision and active learning to accurately segment over 100,000 Brazilian federal legislative bills using a sequence tagging approach. The experiments demonstrated that both BERT and LSTM models achieved high statistical performance without the limitations of rule-based systems. In segmenting long documents beyond the limited context window of BERT, we find that simple moving windows suffice because the required context for accurate legislative segmentation is mostly local. We also conducted an analysis of transfer learning from our monolingual models to French, Italian, German, and English (US) legislative texts. According to our experimental results our models present non-trivial zero-shot and effective out-of-distribution fine-tuning performance, suggesting potential avenues for multilingual legislative segmentation without the need for computationally expensive models.

Yet accessibility refers not only to making legal documents available to the public, but also rendering legal information comprehensible to them. A vexing problem in bringing legal information to the public is how to turn formal legal documents such as legislation and judgments, which are often highly technical, to easily navigable and comprehensible knowledge to those without legal education. In this study, we formulate a three-step approach for bringing legal knowledge to laypersons, tackling the issues of navigability and comprehensibility. First, we translate selected sections of the law into snippets (called CLIC-pages), each being a small piece of article that focuses on explaining certain technical legal concept in layperson's terms. Second, we construct a Legal Question Bank, which is a collection of legal questions whose answers can be found in the CLIC-pages. Third, we design an interactive CLIC Recommender. Given a user's verbal description of a legal situation that requires a legal solution, CRec interprets the user's input and shortlists questions from the question bank that are most likely relevant to the given legal situation and recommends their corresponding CLIC pages where relevant legal knowledge can be found. In this paper we focus on the technical aspects of creating an LQB. We show how large-scale pre-trained language models, such as GPT-3, can be used to generate legal questions. We compare machine-generated questions against human-composed questions and find that MGQs are more scalable, cost-effective, and more diversified, while HCQs are more precise. We also show a prototype of CRec and illustrate through an example how our 3-step approach effectively brings relevant legal knowledge to the public.","2024-09","2024-11-03 16:32:46","2024-11-03 16:32:46","","769-805","","3","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001023368400001","","","","","","","Legal knowledge dissemination; Machine question generation; Navigability and comprehensibility of legal information; Pre-trained language model; READABILITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In such systems, information seekers can receive a concise response to their queries by presenting their questions in natural language. Interactive question answering is a recently proposed and increasingly popular solution that resides at the intersection of question answering and dialogue systems. On the one hand, the user can ask questions in normal language and locate the actual response to her inquiry; on the other hand, the system can prolong the question-answering session into a dialogue if there are multiple probable replies, very few, or ambiguities in the initial request. By permitting the user to ask more questions, interactive question answering enables users to interact with the system and receive more precise results dynamically. This survey offers a detailed overview of the interactive question-answering methods that are prevalent in current literature. It begins by explaining the foundational principles of question-answering systems, hence defining new notations and taxonomies to combine all identified works inside a unified framework. The reviewed published work on interactive question-answering systems is then presented and examined in terms of its proposed methodology, evaluation approaches, and dataset/application domain.

Accordingly, the aim of this study was to provide an overview of the current state of QAS research. It also aimed at highlighting the key limitations and gaps in the existing body of knowledge relating to QAS. Furthermore, it intended to identify the most effective methods utilized in the design of QAS. The systematic review of literature research method was selected as the most appropriate methodology for studying the research topic. This method differs from the conventional literature review as it is more comprehensive and objective. Based on the findings, QAS is a highly active area of research, with scholars taking diverse approaches in the development of their systems. Some of the limitations observed in these studies encompass the focused nature of current QAS, weaknesses associated with models that are used as building blocks for QAS, the need for standard datasets and question formats hence limiting the applicability of the QAS in practical settings, and the failure of researchers to examine their QAS solutions comprehensively. The most effective methods for designing QAS include focusing on syntax and context, utilizing word encoding and knowledge systems, leveraging deep learning, and using elements such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Symbolic processing, performed by the Prolog processing systems which execute unification, resolution, and list operations, is learned by a combination of deep learning models, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Word2Vec training. To our knowledge, the implementation of a Prolog-like processing system using deep learning is a new experiment that has not been conducted in the past. The results of their experiments revealed that the proposed methods are superior to the conventional methods because symbolic processing (1) has rich representations, (2) can interpret inputs even if they include unknown symbols, and (3) can be learned with a small amount of training data. In particular (2), handling of unknown data, which is a major task in artificial intelligence research, is solved using Word2Vec. Furthermore, question answering systems can be built from knowledge bases written in Prolog with learned symbolic processing, which, with conventional methods, is extremely difficult to accomplish. Their proposed systems can not only answer questions through powerful inferences by utilizing facts that harbor unknown data but also have the potential to build knowledge bases from a large amount of data, including unknown data, on the Web. The proposed systems are a completely new trial, there is no state-of-the-art methods in the sense of newest. Therefore, to evaluate their efficiency, they are compared with the most traditional and robust system i.e., the Prolog system. This is new research that encompasses the subjects of conventional artificial intelligence and neural network, and their systems have higher potential to build applications such as FAQ chatbots, decision support systems and energy-efficient estimation using a large amount of information on the Web. Mining hidden information through these applications will provide great value.","2019","2024-11-03 16:33:02","2024-11-03 16:33:02","","152368-152378","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000497163000160","","","","","","","Deep learning; Neural networks; knowledge base; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge discovery; neural machine translation; prolog; question answering system; Reflective binary codes; symbolic processing; Training data; Word2Vec","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, previous scoring-based methods for the multi-choice task suffer from the classification bias problem and can not fully exploit the relationship between reference books, questions, and multi-choice answers. To address the issues, in this paper, we propose a BERT and attention based model for the judicial examination task. Specifically, we first use the BM25 algorithm to retrieve articles in the reference law books to provide certain information to answer a given question. Second, we input a question, its multi-choice answers, and the retrieved relevant articles to BERT for encoding. Third, we input the encoded information to the module of information fuse and match through attention mechanism to find deep relationships in articles, questions, and multi-choice answers. Finally, we concatenate the output of the attention mechanism and input it to a binary classifier to determine whether an answer option to the question is correct. We have done extensive experiments to show that our model significantly outperforms the baselines in accuracy. We also experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of some components of our model.

In recent years, automatic abstractive text summarization has attracted the attention of researchers because large volumes of digital text are readily available in multiple languages on a wide range of topics. Automatically generating precise summaries from large text has potential application in the generation of news headlines, a summary of research articles, the moral of the stories, media marketing, search engine optimization, financial research, social media marketing, question-answering systems, and chatbots. In literature, the problem of abstractive text summarization has been mainly investigated for English and some other languages. However, it has not been thoroughly explored for the Urdu language despite having a huge amount of data available in digital format. To fulfill this gap, this paper presents a large benchmark corpus of 2,067,784 Urdu news articles for the Urdu abstractive text summarization task. As a secondary contribution, we applied a range of deep learning (LSTM, Bi-LSTM, LSTM with attention, GRU, Bi-GRU, and GRU with attention), and large language models (BART and GPT-3.5) on our proposed corpus. Our extensive evaluation on 20,000 test instances showed that GRU with attention model outperforms the other models with ROUGE- 1 = 46.7 , ROUGE- 2 = 24.1 , and ROUGE-L = 48.7.

The legal system, inherently complex and reliant on meticulous documentation, often faces challenges related to time-consuming manual processes and the potential for human errors. The system proposed provides a transformative solution to the above problems. The system emerges as a groundbreaking solution within the intricate landscape of legal systems which responds to these challenges by seamlessly integrating advanced AI techniques. At its core, OpenAI embeddings takes center stage, demonstrating unparalleled proficiency in document generation, comprehension, and abnormality detection, addressing the complexities ingrained in legal documentation. In contrast to traditional approaches, this system maximizes the versatility of ChatGPT 3.5, allowing it to not only issue commands but also proficiently generate a diverse array of legal documents. By incorporating an understanding module equipped with PyPDF, Amazon Textract, and langchain utilities, the system adeptly handles document intricacies. The utilization of OpenAI Embeddings further enhances natural language understanding. Leveraging sentiment analysis and Named Entity Recognition (NER) in its natural language processing (NLP) toolkit, the system employs an intuitive web interface for irregularities detection. The exploration of AI for automated irregularity detection showcases its transformative potential in ensuring document accuracy within the legal domain. This project, therefore, stands as a beacon of innovation, promising to reshape the dynamics of legal document processing by merging advanced AI capabilities with the unique demands of legal systems.","2024","2024-11-03 16:33:22","2024-11-03 16:33:22","","84-91","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001289477900015","","","","","","","LAW; Natural Language Processing (NLP); Irregularities Detection; Legal Document Processing; Legal Technology; OpenAI Embeddings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PERVASIVE COMPUTING AND SOCIAL NETWORKING, ICPCSN 2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
