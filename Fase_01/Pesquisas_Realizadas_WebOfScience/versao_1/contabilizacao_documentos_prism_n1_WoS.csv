In the Netherlands, the planned increase in the online publication of case law is expected to exacerbate this challenge. In this paper, we tried to predict whether court decisions are cited by other courts or not after being published, thus in a way distinguishing between more and less authoritative cases. This type of system may be used to process the large amounts of available data by filtering out large quantities of non-authoritative decisions, thus helping legal practitioners and scholars to find relevant decisions more easily, and drastically reducing the time spent on preparation and analysis. For the Dutch Supreme Court, the match between our prediction and the actual data was relatively strong (with a Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.60). Our results were less successful for the Council of State and the district courts (MCC scores of 0.26 and 0.17, relatively). We also attempted to identify the most informative characteristics of a decision. We found that a completely explainable model, consisting only of handcrafted metadata features, performs almost as well as a less well-explainable system based on all text of the decision.","2024-09","2024-10-27 16:07:34","2024-10-27 16:07:34","","807-837","","3","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001018103700001","","","","","","","Case law; Citation analysis; Judicial decisions; Machine learning; Natural language processing; NETWORK ANALYSIS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

And yet, unlike social biases, our framing tends to fly largely under the radar, as we see in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. Taking three themes from Asimov's work that align with current hegemonic frames, namely the centrality of the individual as the subject, a belief in scientism and technological progress to save humanity, and a dissatisfaction with the limitations of language, this paper explores what, how and why we might exercise caution in the development of natural language processing (NLP) artificial intelligence (AI).

Since the argument plays a significant role in the legal field, the interdisciplinary study of AM on legal texts has significant promise. For years, a pipeline architecture has been used as the standard paradigm in this area. Although this simplifies the development and management of AM systems, the connection between different parts of the pipeline causes inevitable shortcomings such as cascading error propagation. This paper presents an alternative perspective of the AM task, whereby legal documents are represented as graph structures and the AM task is undertaken as a hybrid approach incorporating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), graph augmentation and collective classification. GNNs have been demonstrated to be an effective method for representation learning on graphs, and they have been successfully applied to many other NLP tasks. In contrast to previous pipeline-based architecture, our approach results in a single end-to-end classifier for the identification and classification of argumentative text segments. Experiments based on corpora from both the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) show that our approach achieves strong results compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Both the graph augmentation and collective classification steps are shown to improve performance on both datasets when compared to using GNNs alone.","2023","2024-10-27 16:07:34","2024-10-27 16:07:34","","371-380","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001139079400039","","","","","","","Argument Mining; Graph Neural Networks; Legal Text","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PROCEEDINGS OF THE 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW, ICAIL 2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The inter-annotator agreement is substantial (kappa =0.75). In experiments with a rule-based and a transformer-based method, results show that the transformerbased method performs quite well on the dataset (accuracy > 0.8).

Measuring and linking policy substance and legislative context","REGULATION & GOVERNANCE","","1748-5983","10.1111/rego.12528","","There is growing scholarly interest in analyzing changes in policies, laws, and regulations. Some concepts depart from the goal of identifying changes in policy substance. Other contributions have concentrated on the structural characteristics of laws and regulations containing these substantive changes. Extracting measures of policy substance from legislative texts is a challenging and time-consuming endeavor as it requires the manual assessment and coding of legal acts. The assessment of the structural characteristics of laws and regulations, by contrast, can be done applying automated natural language processing. An important critical question is, thus, whether we can combine these approaches and simplify the information extraction by inferring changes in the policy substance from the legislative context in which these changes are embedded. Examining more than 100 legal acts in the area of EU environmental and climate policy, we find that the measures capturing policy substance and the structural characteristics of legal acts context are not systematically linked. In other words: changes in the structural features of legal acts cannot be used as an approximation for changes in policy substance. We conclude by sketching out a research agenda when (and when not) to use the different concepts and related measurements.","2024-07","2024-10-27 16:07:35","2024-10-27 16:07:35","","724-739","","3","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000984792200001","","","","","","","LAW; COMPLEXITY; EUROPEAN-UNION; EVOLUTION; EXPANSION; NATIONAL CLIMATE POLICIES; OUTPUTS; policy accumulation; policy change; policy complexity; political science data; POLITICS; STATES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is, however, no publicly available repository of judgments concerning the emerging practice area of animal protection law. This has hindered the identification of individual animal protection law judgments and comprehension of the scale of animal protection law made by courts. Thus, we detail the creation of an initial animal protection law repository using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. This involved domain expert classification of 500 judgments according to whether or not they were concerned with animal protection law. 400 of these judgments were used to train various models, each of which was used to predict the classification of the remaining 100 judgments. The predictions of each model were superior to a baseline measure intended to mimic current searching practice, with the best performing model being a support vector machine (SVM) approach that classified judgments according to term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) values. Investigation of this model consisted of considering its most influential features and conducting an error analysis of all incorrectly predicted judgments. This showed the features indicative of animal protection law judgments to include terms such as 'welfare', 'hunt' and 'cull', and that incorrectly predicted judgments were often deemed marginal decisions by the domain expert. The TF-IDF SVM was then used to classify non-labelled judgments, resulting in an initial animal protection law repository. Inspection of this repository suggested that there were 175 animal protection judgments between January 2000 and December 2020 from the Privy Council, House of Lords, Supreme Court and upper England and Wales courts.","2023-06","2024-10-27 16:07:35","2024-10-27 16:07:35","","293-324","","2","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000792091600001","","","","","","","Machine learning; Court judgments; Document classification; Support vector machine; TF-IDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regulatory agencies play a crucial role in modern societies by issuing regulations. While most regulations are promulgated as rules with public notice and comment procedures, administrative guidance documents are as abundant but less studied. They have less formal requirements and are meant as non-binding guidelines, yet skeptics argue they are often used to evade judicial review, and courts turn to their text to inquire whether they are effectively binding. Recent advancements in text analysis methods have allowed scholars to analyze regulatory text, including the measurement of binding language. However, guidance documents have not been part of this trend, largely due to their inaccessibility. This article contributes to the field of empirical legal studies and administrative law by constructing a novel dataset of guidance documents, leveraging a unique policy change. It uses text analysis methods with qualitative insights from doctrinal court decisions, and finds that guidance documents are in fact less binding than rules, but that binding language increased over time and that substantial portions of available documents score higher than a document struck down by a court.","2023","2024-10-27 16:07:35","2024-10-27 16:07:35","","407-411","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001139079400045","","","","","","","natural language processing; administrative law; guidance; regulation; RULEMAKING; rules","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PROCEEDINGS OF THE 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW, ICAIL 2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A graph-based data structure called ASKE Conceptual Graph is initially populated through a data preparation step, and it is continuously enriched at each ASKE generation with results of document chunk classification, new extracted terminology, and newly derived concepts. A quantitative evaluation of ASKE knowledge extraction and document classification is provided by considering the EurLex dataset. Furthermore, we present the results of applying ASKE to a real case-study of Italian case law decisions with qualitative feedback from legal experts in the framework of an ongoing national research project.","2024-04","2024-10-27 16:07:35","2024-10-27 16:07:35","","","","","52","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001096933600001","","","","","","","Natural Language Processing; Digital justice; Legal knowledge extraction; Legal knowledge graph","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examine the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which allowed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to move cases into its administrative court. The problem with this policy experiment is that the SEC retains the discretion to bring cases in federal court, so it is impossible to identify which cases the policy treats. We propose a difference-in-differences design, using natural-language-processing methods to create control and treatment groups. We construct propensity scores using random-forest methods. After binning cases into likely or not likely to be affected by the courts' expansion, the difference-in-differences estimation indicates that the expansion made defendants 30 percentage points more likely to settle and 36 percentage points more likely to receive a nonmonetary penalty. There is a 24-percentage-point reduction in the likelihood of a monetary penalty.","2023-11-01","2024-10-27 16:07:35","2024-10-27 16:07:35","","797-835","","4","66","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001158856800003","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In achieving this function, contractual parties routinely include a force majeure clause in their contracts to be excused from performance in the face of a supervening event. But how do force majeure clauses allocate risks? This Article breaks down this inquiry into three interrelated questions: (i) why do parties include force majeure clauses considering the robust common law excuse doctrines such as impossibility? (ii) How have courts historically approached force majeure clauses? And (iii) what serves as the most equitable and efficient framework for the risk-allocative function of force majeure clauses? This Article's fresh look at force majeure clauses will inform courts' approach to a slew of claims arising out of Covid-19 disruptions and future shocks. Using empirical methods (including machine learning and natural language processing) and doctrinal analysis, this Article makes the following contributions: First, based on empirical analysis of force majeure clauses and behavioral economics, it argues that parties primarily do away with common law's basic assumption (ex ante) requirement in their force majeure clauses to focus instead on ex post analysis. Second, 'using computational methods on force majeure cases since 1810, it shows that the control factor (as opposed to foreseeability, parties' intent, and contractual language) has been the leading factor in courts' decisions. Third, the Article normatively suggests an overhaul shift towards a proportional ex post analysis of force majeure clauses which allocates risks pursuant to promisor's measures to control the effects of the supervening event and promisee's degree of reliance on contractual promises.","2022","2024-10-27 16:07:35","2024-10-27 16:07:35","","805-860","","2","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000784260700006","","","","","","","LAW; CONSENT; DOCTRINE; ECONOMIC-THEORY; FRUSTRATION; INCOMPLETE CONTRACTS; OFFER; PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL; RULES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

THE PROMISE AND PERILS OF USING SOCIAL MEDIA TO REVEAL LAY PUNISHMENT PERSPECTIVES","UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS LAW REVIEW","","0276-9948","","","For centuries, penal theorists have debated two key criminal justice questions: justifying state punishment power and determining proper pun-ishment levels. Moral philosophers offered several theories to address these questions. Over time, calls emerged to move beyond theories and to con-sider community views on punishment rationales in criminal law and policy design, an approach that gained support alongside meaningful critique. Concurrently, social science advancements enabled empirically deepening understanding of public attitudes about punishment, largely through sur-veys and experiments. One domain, however, remained untouched by those calling to assess lay intuitions of justice: social media. Such oversight is puzzling in light of social media's potential to reveal public perceptions without scientific in-tervention. This Article thus engages with two main questions. First, a methodological question: whether social media discourse can be used to reflect laypeople's attitudes about criminal culpability and punishment, and second, a normative question: should it be used for these purposes? To answer these questions, the Article first synthesizes current schol-arship about the promises and challenges of using social media data to study human behavior and applies it to the context of punishment justifica-tions. The Article moves beyond theory, however, and utilizes recent tech-nological developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence (""AI"") and Law and Natural Language Processing (""NLP"") to offer a novel empirical exploration of the potential promise of social media discourse in assessing community views on justice and punishment. While our findings offer some support for the potentiality of using so-cial media to assess laypeople's attitudes regarding punishment, we also expose the complex challenges of utilizing such data, particularly for penal law and policy design. First, due to a host of methodological challenges, and second, due to normative challenges, particularly social media's po-larizing nature and the ambiguity around who's voice is amplified through these platforms. The Article thus urges caution when leveraging social me-dia to evaluate the public's perceptions of justice.","2023","2024-10-27 16:07:35","2024-10-27 16:07:35","","1473-1532","","5","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001097478400002","","","","","","","DESERTS; EXPRESSIVE FUNCTION; FACEBOOK; MOTIVES; PUBLIC-OPINION; UTILITY; VIEWS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

NER is a fundamental task, that identify named entities in text such as people, organizations, and locations. In Legal domain, NER is particularly important due to the variety of named entities that appear in legal documents and are important for legal analysis whereas Semantic classification is the process of giving each sentence in a text a semantic label, such as ""fact,""""arguments,"" or""judgement"". Both NER and Semantic classi- fication are critical component of many NLP applications such as Knowledge base construction and semantic search. Semantic searching of legal documents is a powerful technique that can be used to quickly find the information that you need. By combining NER and semantic classification, one can identify the key elements of a legal document and search for documents that are related to a particular topic or contain a particular type of information. This paper proposes a novel approach to NER and Semantic classification in legal domain using Long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The proposed approach is evaluated on a corpus of legal text and the result of this study suggest that LSTM models are a promising approach for NER and Semantic classification in legal domain and can be used to improve the performance of semantic searching of legal documents.","2024-04-27","2024-10-27 16:07:35","2024-10-27 16:07:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001208833500001","","","","","","","Law; INFORMATION; Legal judgement; Long Short Term Memory(LSTM); Name Entity Recognition(NER)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"28WXY4UD","journalArticle","2024","Choi, JH","Measuring Clarity in Legal Text","UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO LAW REVIEW","","0041-9494","","","Legal cases often turn on judgments of textual clarity: when the text is unclear, judges allow extrinsic evidence in contract disputes, consult legislative history in statutory interpretation, and more. Despite this, almost no empirical work considers the nature or prevalence of legal clarity. Scholars and judges who study real-world documents to inform the interpretation of legal text primarily treat unclear text as a research problem to be solved with more data rather than a fundamental feature of language.This Article makes both theoretical and empirical contributions to the legal concept of textual clarity. It first advances a theory of clarity that distinguishes between information and determinacy. A judge might find text unclear because she personally lacks sufficient information to decide which interpretation is best; alternatively, she might find it unclear because the text itself is fundamentally indeterminate. Fundamental linguistic indeterminacy explains ongoing interpretive debates and limits the potential for text-focused methods (including corpus linguistics) to decide cases.With this theoretical background, the Article then proposes a new method to algorithmically evaluate textual clarity. Applying techniques from natural language processing and artificial intelligence that measure the semantic similarity between words, we can shed valuable new light on questions of legal interpretation.This Article finds that text is frequently indeterminate in real-world legal cases. Moreover, estimates of similarity vary substantially from corpus to corpus, even for large and reputable corpora. This suggests that word use is highly corpus specific and that meaning can vary even between general-purpose corpora that theoretically capture ordinary meaning.These empirical findings have important implications for ongoing doctrinal debates, suggesting that text is less clear and objective than many textualists believe. Ultimately, the Article offers new insights both to theorists considering the role of legal text and to empiricists seeking to understand how text is used in the real world.","2024-01","2024-10-27 16:07:35","2024-10-27 16:07:35","","1-82","","1","91","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001140085100003","","","","","","","LAW; CONSENSUS; CONTRACT INTERPRETATION; CORPUS; DELEGATION; STATUTORY INTERPRETATION; TEXTUALISM; VAGUENESS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper begins by investigating the methodological challenges in documenting and verifying the 90th-percentile claim, presenting four sets of findings that indicate that OpenAI's estimates of GPT-4's UBE percentile are overinflated. First, although GPT-4's UBE score nears the 90th percentile when examining approximate conversions from February administrations of the Illinois Bar Exam, these estimates are heavily skewed towards repeat test-takers who failed the July administration and score significantly lower than the general test-taking population. Second, data from a recent July administration of the same exam suggests GPT-4's overall UBE percentile was below the 69th percentile, and similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 48th percentile on essays. Third, examining official NCBE data and using several conservative statistical assumptions, GPT-4's performance against first-time test takers is estimated to be similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 62nd percentile, including similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 42nd percentile on essays. Fourth, when examining only those who passed the exam (i.e. licensed or license-pending attorneys), GPT-4's performance is estimated to drop to similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 48th percentile overall, and similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 15th percentile on essays. In addition to investigating the validity of the percentile claim, the paper also investigates the validity of GPT-4's reported scaled UBE score of 298. The paper successfully replicates the MBE score, but highlights several methodological issues in the grading of the MPT + MEE components of the exam, which call into question the validity of the reported essay score. Finally, the paper investigates the effect of different hyperparameter combinations on GPT-4's MBE performance, finding no significant effect of adjusting temperature settings, and a significant effect of few-shot chain-of-thought prompting over basic zero-shot prompting. Taken together, these findings carry timely insights for the desirability and feasibility of outsourcing legally relevant tasks to AI models, as well as for the importance for AI developers to implement rigorous and transparent capabilities evaluations to help secure safe and trustworthy AI.","2024-03-30","2024-10-27 16:07:35","2024-10-27 16:30:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001194581100001","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence and law; LAW; Law and technology; Legal analytics; Legal NLP; Legal profession; Machine learning; Natural language processing; NLP","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper investigates the use of AI in a critical issue in employment law, the determination of a worker's status-employee vs. independent contractor-in two common law countries (the U.S. and Canada). This legal question has been a contentious labor issue insofar as independent contractors are not eligible for the same benefits as employees. It has become an important societal issue due to the ubiquity of the gig economy and the recent disruptions in employment arrangements. To address this problem, we collected, annotated, and structured the data for all Canadian and Californian court cases related to this legal question between 2002 and 2021, resulting in 538 Canadian cases and 217 U.S. cases. In contrast to legal literature focusing on complex and correlated characteristics of the employment relationship, our statistical analyses of the data show very strong correlations between the worker's status and a small subset of quantifiable characteristics of the employment relationship. In fact, despite the variety of situations in the case law, we show that simple, off-the-shelf AI models classify the cases with an out-of-sample accuracy of more than 90%. Interestingly, the analysis of misclassified cases reveals consistent misclassification patterns by most algorithms. Legal analyses of these cases led us to identify how equity is ensured by judges in ambiguous situations. Finally, our findings have practical implications for access to legal advice and justice. We deployed our AI model via the open-access platform, https://MyOpenCourt.org/, to help users answer employment legal questions. This platform has already assisted many Canadian users, and we hope it will help democratize access to legal advice to large crowds.","2023-03-30","2024-10-27 16:07:53","2024-10-27 16:07:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000961487000001","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; Decision-support legal systems; Employment law; Predictive models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By automating complex decisions and processing extensive datasets, AI promises to enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of trade and dispute resolution. This research delves into AI's potential applications within the WTO, highlighting how predictive analytics and decision support systems could transform trade dispute resolutions. However, the integration of AI also presents challenges, including ethical concerns, the need for transparency, and data privacy issues. Balancing these challenges with the benefits of AI is crucial to maintaining fairness and accuracy in legal processes. This paper advocates for international collaboration to establish standards guiding AI applications in international trade and dispute resolution, ensuring that technological advancements support the WTO's goals without compromising the integrity of the legal system. A new legal framework is essential to harness the full potential of AI while mitigating associated risks, ensuring that advancements in AI contribute to a more equitable, efficient, and transparent global trade system. Emphasizing the broader implications, the integration of AI technologies is posited as a cornerstone for promoting free trade and opening up the world economy. By reducing barriers and enhancing access, AI has the potential to drive global economic integration and foster a more interconnected market environment. This vision aligns with contemporary global trade objectives, advocating for a harmonious blend of technology and traditional trade principles to navigate the complexities of modern international relations and trade policies.

Legal personality is the cornerstone of the operation of law and legal systems. Similarly, innovation provides the core justification for intellectual property rights. AI systems have demonstrated the ability to produce novel inventions. Ordinarily, the inventor would be the recipient of patents for their inventions. However, AI systems lack legal personality. Thus, should patent law protect inventions made by inventors lacking legal personality? We analyse three jurisdictions-the UK, the US and Australia-and their respective approaches to AI inventors, to explore the conflict between legal personality questions and innovation. The article argues that legal personality is essential for the grant of patent rights and that refusing the entitlement of AI systems to patents is the correct approach.

This is not just about using technologies related to videoconferencing, automated distribution, digital evidence, etc. Development is constantly and rapidly moving forward, and we are now facing issues related to the use of artificial intelligence technologies in criminal proceedings. Such changes also entail new threats and challenges - we are referring to the challenges of respecting fundamental human rights and freedoms in the context of technological development. In addition, there is the matter of ensuring the implementation of basic legal principles, such as the presumption of innocence, non-discrimination and the protection of the right to privacy. This concern arises when applying artificial intelligence systems in the criminal justice system. Methods: The general philosophical framework of this research consisted of axiological and hermeneutic approaches, which allowed us to conduct a value analysis of fundamental human rights and changes in their perception in the context of the AI application, as well as apply in-depth study and interpretation of legal texts. While building up the system of the basic principles of using AI systems in criminal justice, we used the system-structural and logical methods of research. The study also relied on the comparative law method in terms of comparing legal regulation and law enforcement practice in different legal systems. The method of legal modelling was applied to emphasise the main areas of possible application of AI systems in criminal proceedings. Results and Conclusions: The article identifies the main possible vectors of the use of artificial intelligence systems in criminal proceedings and assesses the feasibility and prospects of their implementation. In addition, it is stated that only using AI systems for auxiliary purposes carries minimal risks of interference with human rights and freedoms. Instead, other areas of AI adoption may significantly infringe rights and freedoms, and therefore the use of AI for such purposes should be fully controlled, verified and only subsidiary, and in certain cases, prohibited altogether.","2023-08","2024-10-27 16:07:53","2024-10-27 16:07:53","","147-166","","3","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001069365200001","","","","","","","artificial intelligence; human rights; criminal proceedings; digital technologies; predictive justice, Ukraine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within the broader field of law and literature, the relationship between law and science fiction, especially time travel stories, is rich and useful. Themes and concepts in time travel can be applied in the exploration of existing legal philosophies as well as a more expansive and engaging study of power, authority, freedom, and a number of global issues. As governments and people worldwide wrestle with climate change, armed conflict, pandemics, and the increasing significance of artificial intelligence and other advances in technology, time travel stories give students unique contexts in which to consider what law is and the degree to which it defines human experience. For generations, brilliant science fiction writers have offered thought-provoking stories and worlds that law professors and their students can use to reimagine legal thought and practice. Like its close relatives, mythology and fantasy, the science fiction genre is untethered to current social or political experience or projections necessarily corrupted by narrowly conceived historical perspectives. Science fiction writers are interested in illuminating possibilities by considering identifiable problems in unidentifiable environments. It is no accident that gender identity, racism, reproductive rights, extremist ideologies, global health crises, and various recognizable forms of labor exploitation are addressed in provocative and insightful ways by a number of the best science fiction writers. Law has a strong presence in their work. Judges, law givers, ruling groups, and other less familiar forms of power and control appear in these stories and help to move and shape the experience of the time traveler. Law students can draw on the work of these writers to consider old questions in new and refreshingly broad ways. The importance of communication and access to information are also strong themes common to law and science fiction. How are concepts of truth and propaganda significant to power? Is truth necessary for legitimacy? Information technologies introduced in the science fiction world now exist in real time in forms and with speed and volume unimagined even a few decades ago. As artificial intelligence becomes dominant in many aspects of our daily lives, law students must consider how it may change law making, court procedures, entire legal systems, and perhaps even concepts of justice. As a project, law students might develop a case and conduct a trial using an AI judge or try a case to an AI jury. How human is the law? The role of emotional intelligence and concepts like mercy, restorative justice, forgiveness, or retribution are also things they might explore in seminars or other classes using science fiction literature and other time travel media as a framework.","2022-11-01","2024-10-27 16:07:53","2024-10-27 16:07:53","","355-378","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000882351900007","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence; Emotional Intelligence and the Law; Law and Literature; Law and Science Fiction; Law and Time Travel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main objective of this article is to determine the forms and directions, risks and benefits, prospects for the use of artificial intelligence in administrative judicial procedure, taking into account foreign experience in legal regulation in this area. The concept of ""artificial intelligence"" is investigated. It is emphasized that the use of artificial intelligence technologies in administrative judicial procedure is an acceptable use only of specialized intelligent systems that can work under human control. It is stated that when considering administrative cases in an administrative court of minor complexity, it is possible to use artificial intelligence technologies, which will be able to independently generalize and analyze legislation, judicial practice and be a recommendation for a judge when making a fair and lawful decision on the principles of the rule of law. It has been established that the use of artificial intelligence technologies in administrative proceedings provides opportunities for the effective implementation of the right to judicial protection, but can be used to take actions that are contrary to the rule of law, in particular regarding the violation of the right to a fair trial in administrative cases in administrative courts. The latter requires the improvement of legal regulation of the use of artificial intelligence technologies in administrative judicial procedure using international principles and standards.","2023-10","2024-10-27 16:07:53","2024-10-27 16:07:53","","346-362","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001090715000002","","","","","","","artificial intelligence; administrative judicial procedure; digital technology; electronic technology; legal regulation; right to judicial protection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building upon the definitions of soft law discussed in legal scholarship, it proposes a way of structuring the regulatory landscape on AI and of addressing the question of what is included in the ""soft law of AI"" today. By adopting a building-blocks approach (combining distinct definitional components of soft law), the paper shows that the state of current soft law on AI depends on which position on international law one defends. Concretely, the paper firstly offers a complete codebook for identifying the different types of soft law. Secondly, it applies this codebook as a proof-of-concept for the research proposal by analyzing 40+ ethical guidelines and by clustering preliminary results according to the actor enacting the guidelines and the legally relevant effects they could deploy. Four paradigmatic types of soft law emerge: statist and international organization soft law, process-oriented soft law, expertise -oriented soft law, and de facto relevant standards soft law.

After much, albeit selective, debate, it seems to be gaining increasing practical relevance through intense AI-related market activity, an initial set of case law on the matter, and policy initiatives by international organizations and lawmakers. Against this background, Zurich University's Center for Intellectual Property and Competition Law is conducting, together with the Swiss Intellectual Property Institute, a research and policy project that explores the future of intellectual property law in an AI context. This paper briefly describes the AI/IP Research Project and presents an initial set of policy recommendations for the development of IP law with a view to AI. The recommendations address topics such as AI inventorship in patent law; AI authorship in copyright law; the need for sui generis rights to protect innovative AI output; rules for the allocation of AI-related IPRs; IP protection carve-outs in order to facilitate AI system development, training, and testing; the use of AI tools by IP offices; and suitable software protection and data usage regimes.","2023-07","2024-10-27 16:07:53","2024-10-27 16:07:53","","916-940","","6","54","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001011509900001","","","","","","","Machine learning; AI; Artificial intelligence; Copyright; America Invents Act; DABUS; Deep learning; Intellectual property law; Neural networks; Patents; Software protection; Text and data mining; Trade secrets","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AI was originally created by humans as a consequence of the massive digital revolution. Recently, AI has also developed rapidly to perform functions like humans and even produce works of intellectual property like humans, such as creating songs, making new inventions, making industrial designs, and so on. Thus, it is a question whether AI can be qualified as a legal subject of creator, inventor or designer and then register as intellectual property.

The UK Supreme Court decision in Thaler v Comptroller of Patents, Designs and Trademarks has provided an ultimate answer to this question: AI cannot be an inventor for the purposes of patent law. This note argues, first, that while such a human-centric approach to inventorship might discourage the use and development of AI technologies with autonomous invention capabilities, it will help retain an active human involvement in technologically supported inventive processes and continuously foster human ingenuity. Second, despite the Court focusing on what patent law is and not on what the law should be, the decision will be influential in the ongoing discussions on the future of patent law and will make it more difficult to expand patent law to incorporate non-human inventors. Third, the decision has opened, or revealed, the gaps in patent law that the emergence of AI technologies have created and for which new legal solutions will be needed, especially with relation to the ownership of AI-assisted inventions and the validation of inventorship claims.","2024-07-05","2024-10-27 16:07:54","2024-10-27 16:07:54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001263080800001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through its role in limiting the exercise of arbitrary power, the Rule of Law plays a crucial role in society. Where popular Rule of Law conceptions were frequently shaped by their authors' fears, the Rule of Law is a product of fear. The operation of AI in society is also tainted by fear. This fear is exacerbated by science fiction accounts that frequently portray AI as complicit in a dystopian future. This portrayal of AI's role is capable of generating a state of fear in society that assists in priming society to accept a different form of the Rule of Law in the future. In other words, where contemporary ideas of the Rule of Law are shaped by fear, and where fear exists in relation to AI's exercise of constitutional power (and where this is influenced by depictions of AI in science fiction), fears associated with AI's exercise of power may shape future conceptions of the Rule of Law.","2022","2024-10-27 16:07:54","2024-10-27 16:07:54","","124-136","","2","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000892027600009","","","","","","","artificial intelligence; GOVERNMENT; FUTURE; concept; conception; fear; Rule of Law; science fiction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since AI in the work context has increasingly become important in organising work and managing workers, the AI Act will undoubtedly have an impact on EU and national labour law systems. One aim of the proposal is to guarantee 'consistency with existing Union legislation applicable to sectors where high-risk Artificial Intelligence systems are already used or likely to be used in the near future', which includes the EU social acquis. It could be argued that ensuring true consistency with EU law means guaranteeing that the way the AI Act will be implemented and applied will still allow the other pieces of EU labour law to fulfil their purpose. It is undeniable that the implementation of the AI Act will overlap with various fields of EU law, especially considering the increasing use of AI technology at work. Thus, this article seeks to identify ways to refine the AI Act, insofar as it impacts work. The contribution discusses the current AI Act as proposed in April 2021, thereby focusing on two particular areas, EU non-discrimination law and EU law on occupational health and safety (OSH), as these two areas are, more or less explicitly, addressed as legal fields in the AI Act. The article starts with taking the perspective of EU labour law influencing the development of AI systems used in the employment context. We argue that providers should respect EU labour law throughout the development of the AI system (section 2). Then, the areas where EU labour law and the AI overlap are identified, thereby viewing it from an employer's perspective, i.e., the user of the AI system (section 3). Using two specific EU labour law areas (the right not to be discriminated against and the right to healthy and safe working conditions) the article provides a first assessment of how the AI Act might influence work and the regulation thereof (section 4). Finally, the conclusion critically explores whether and to what extent AI in employment situations warrants particular attention (section 5).","2022-12","2024-10-27 16:07:54","2024-10-27 16:07:54","","542-562","","4","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000891132300006","","","","","","","AI Act; EU labour law; non-discrimination; occupational health and safety; worker protection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The EU and China serve as two different examples of how to achieve the extraterritorial applicability of AI laws and regulations. The former shows an explicit territorial extension with more trigger factors, whereas the latter shows vertical regulation with a narrower territorial scope. Both countries' legislative motivations differ but also have some commonalities. One of the primary goals of extraterritorial application of domestic laws is to protect citizens within their territory. The digital economy's characteristics make it necessary for AI laws to have extraterritorial effects. Without international conventions or treaties, there is a legal vacuum in AI regulation. Additionally, the extraterritorial application of AI laws and regulations helps a state become a global standardsetter and gain an international sphere of influence. However, the extraterritorial application of AI laws and regulations sometimes functions as a form of legal imperialism. This exacerbates the injustice between great powers and weak countries in AI competition. To justify the legitimacy of the extraterritorial application of AI laws and regulations, it is beneficial to adopt the 'inner morality of extraterritoriality', a theoretical framework proposed by Professor Dan Svantesson. In fact, extraterritorial applicability depends on the market size and attractiveness. For other countries, whether their AI laws and regulations are endowed with extraterritorial effects is their prerogative. However, they should consider their soft power before implementing legislation.","2024-07","2024-10-27 16:07:54","2024-10-27 16:07:54","","","","","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001224139700001","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Extraterritorial effects; Global governance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The examination of the AI's legal personality takes into account the modern anthropocentrism standpoint, where humans are perceived as the central figure in the legal system. A human, as a subject of law, plays a crucial role in constructing legal reality. Through exercising his powers, a human transforms abstract norms into existing law. The proposal to delegate this anthropological function to AI carries significant risks that may have detrimental effects on the established system of legal regulation for public relations. The correlation between law-making and law enforcement, as integral components in establishing legal reality, pertains to the legal consciousness of individuals as subjects of law. This correlation does not necessitate the substitution of human decision- making with AI. Simultaneously, AI is capable of effectively handling auxiliary legal tasks. It possesses the necessary skills to draft regulatory acts, court decisions, and consolidate proposals obtained through law-making crowdsourcing. Additionally, it is proficient in executing automated actions, such as issuing writs of execution. The utilization of AI to implement the concept of machine- readable law and algorithmize the application of legal norms appears to hold promise. The incorporation of a digital state notion, which pertains to the transition of public service provision into digital format, is also unattainable without AI, which greatly enhances the public administration efficiency. In this case, the focal point will revolve around the matter of attaining effective control over decisions carried out by AI, as well as the prescribed boundaries of its capabilities within the legal domain, as established by legislative measures.","2024","2024-10-27 16:07:54","2024-10-27 16:07:54","","516-526","","2","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001288915700014","","","","","","","artificial intelligence; digitalization; law enforcement; law-making; legal consciousness.; legal norm; subject of law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Copyright Law and Originality in the Age of Artificial Intelligence","AUSTRALIAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY JOURNAL","","1038-1635","","","The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and the implications that it has for authorship has created a crisis within copyright law. There has been much debate about whether copyright should permit AI authorship within its borders. However, the major question that needs to be addressed is really what happens after AI-authored or AI-augmented works are permitted within the boundaries of copyright law. What would be the implications for originality? Where works have been concerned, originality has long been the primary doctrinal vehicle gatekeeping entry into the copyright system. A change in the law that would permit AI-authored or AI-augmented works to sit within the system of copyright protection would call that role into question. In this article, we argue that originality will face challenges, but it will survive as a re-purposed doctrine delineating which level of protection a work may enjoy.","2023","2024-10-27 16:07:54","2024-10-27 16:07:54","","","","3","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000993070100002","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In accomplishing such tasks, they may intentionally commit 'AI crimes', ie engage in behaviour which would be considered a crime if it were accomplished by humans. For instance, an advanced AI trading agent may-despite its designer's best efforts-autonomously manipulate markets while lacking the properties for being held criminally responsible. In such cases (hard AI crimes) a criminal responsibility gap emerges since no agent (human or artificial) can be legitimately punished for this outcome. We aim to shift the 'hard AI crime' discussion from blame to deterrence and design an 'AI deterrence paradigm', separate from criminal law and inspired by the economic theory of crime. The homo economicus has come to life as a machina economica, which, even if cannot be meaningfully blamed, can nevertheless be effectively deterred since it internalises criminal sanctions as costs.","2024-05-07","2024-10-27 16:07:54","2024-10-27 16:07:54","","673-701","","3","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001215165200001","","","","","","","LAW; artificial intelligence; criminal law; deterrence; law and economics; legal theory; responsibility; ROBOTS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current AI regulations in regions like the EU, UK, and Canada fall short in addressing the complexities of cross-border arbitration and ensuring interoperability. By emphasising the distinct contributions of the proposed UNCITRAL Model Law and arbitration institutions, the paper highlights a multi-faceted strategy to overcome challenges posed by outdated international conventions, inconsistencies in bilateral investment treaties, and the lack of comprehensive guidance.

Since the system cannot be liable on its own account either, existing laws expose victims to accountability gaps and need to be reformed. Recent legal instruments have nonetheless established obligations against AI developers and providers. Drawing on attribution theory, this paper examines how these seemingly opposing positions are shaped by the ways in which AI systems are conceptualised. Specifically, folk dispositionism underpins conventional legal discourse on AI liability, personality, publications, and inventions and leads us towards problematic legal outcomes. Examining the technology and terminology driving contemporary AI systems, the paper contends that AI systems are better conceptualised instead as situational characters whose actions remain constrained by their programming. Properly viewing AI systems as such illuminates how existing legal doctrines could be sensibly applied to AI and reinforces emerging calls for placing greater scrutiny on the broader AI ecosystem.","2023-12","2024-10-27 16:07:54","2024-10-27 16:07:54","","583-602","","4","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000933699000001","","","","","","","artificial intelligence; law and technology; attribution theory; autonomous systems; law and psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Once a matter of science fiction, significant developments in AI are now being regularly reported and the public is becoming more familiar with AI through applications relying on ordinary English language commands. One of the most recent applications, ChatGPT, has given people a taste of what AI may be able to accomplish. While interest in AI is rising, key questions remain about how ready intellectual property (IP) laws are for the revolution it promises to bring. Can AI invent? And even if it can create, can the creations be protected under copyright laws? Recent cases, particularly those pursued by Dr Stephen Thaler reveal a raft of problems with the interaction between AI and inventions and creations under existing IP laws, including whether AI has the legal personality necessary to qualify as an inventor or creator. The resultant category of inventions and creations may be denied any form of protection. Is this the IP system we intend or is it increasingly deficient in addressing the impact of AI, in terms of incentives and regulations around both ingestion and output?

In this context, concerns have arisen about whether and when AI-enabled price discrimination amounts to an abuse of dominance under competition law and would require a legal response. To address these concerns, this paper will analyze AI-enabled price discrimination from a comparative law and economics perspective. In economics, price discrimination is not always undesirable as it can increase static efficiency, and, on some occasions, it can promote dynamic efficiency and boost consumer welfare. Nevertheless, it may also lead to exclusionary and exploitative effects, especially once Tech Giants abuse their dominant positions in relevant markets. Since the protection of free competition and consumer welfare are objectives of competition law in China and the EU, competition law seems a proper instrument to step into digital markets to address these concerns. Indeed, the EU and China have established mixed regimes of competition law and other rules to tackle unfair and/or anti-competitive AI-enabled price discrimination. As such, AI-enabled price discrimination does not always require a competition law response and it requires competition authorities to make a trade-off between different considerations.","2023-10","2024-10-27 16:07:54","2024-10-27 16:07:54","","51-72","","1-4","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000977817800001","","","","","","","Abuse of dominance; AI-enabled price discrimination; Competition law intervention; Consumer welfare; Efficiency; Exclusionary and exploitative effects; OUTPUT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, however, there are discrete AI applications that might not merely be accommodated by Delaware corporate law, but perhaps eventually required.

Thus, who should be considered to have caused work to be created when work is created by AI? Alternatively, can it be said that no person has caused the work to be created? This paper answers these questions from the perspective of Indian Copyright Law and copyright law justifications, while briefly looking at the position in other jurisdictions such as the US and UK. It also provides possible solutions to the issue of authorship and ownership in work created by AI which include - the work entering into the public domain, compulsory licenses being sought to make use of the work, recognition of limited personhood for AI, joint authorship for the persons involved or recognizing a sui generis right in work created by AI.","2022-06","2024-10-27 16:07:55","2024-10-27 16:07:55","","1-12","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000923950300002","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence; 1957; Computer-generated work; Copyright Act; Copyright Law; Ownership","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meanwhile, in legal and ethical discussions, the challenge is generally framed as ensuring that humans retain 'control' over AI such that responsible operators can reliably guide the behaviour of AI systems as required by legal and other norms. Surprisingly, few have asked whether the paradigms of 'trust' and 'control' are guiding development of the human-AI relationship in the same direction. This paper outlines the nature of trust and control as they relate to regulation of the human-AI relationship and surveys some challenges which arise in regulating the military uptake of AI systems.","2022-12-31","2024-10-27 16:07:55","2024-10-27 16:07:55","","472-483","","4","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000954316000001","","","","","","","artificial intelligence; control; international law; law of armed conflict; military technology; ROME STATUTE; trust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AI systems are characterised by their complexity, opacity and autonomy in operation. Now and in the foreseeable future, AI systems will be operating in a manner that is not fully autonomous. This signifies that providing appropriate incentives to the human parties involved is still of great importance in reducing AI-related harm. Therefore, liability rules should be adapted in such a way to provide the relevant parties with incentives to efficiently reduce the social costs of potential accidents. Relying on a law and economics approach, we address the theoretical question of what kind of liability rules should be applied to different parties along the value chain related to AI.

Contrary to existing literature, this article suggests that the most far-reaching and effective EU rules for AI applications in the digital economy will not be contained in the proposed AI Act, but in the Digital Markets Act (DMA). We analyse the impact of the DMA and related EU acts on AI models and underlying data across four key areas: disclosure requirements; the regulation of AI training data; access rules; and the regime for fair rankings. We demonstrate that fairness, under the DMA, goes beyond traditionally protected categories of non-discrimination law on which scholarship at the intersection of AI and law has focused on. Rather, we draw on competition law and the FRAND criteria known from intellectual property law to interpret and refine the DMA provisions on fair rankings. Moreover, we show how, based on Court of Justice of the European Union jurisprudence, a coherent interpretation of the concept of non-discrimination in both traditional non-discrimination and competition law may be found.

The success of automatic text simplification systems is highly dependent on the quality of parallel data used for training and evaluation. To advance sentence simplification and document simplification in German, this paper presents DEPLAIN, a new dataset of parallel, professionally written and manually aligned simplifications in plain German (""plain DE"" or in German: 'Einfache Sprache""). DEPLAIN consists of a newsdomain (approx. 500 document pairs, approx. 13k sentence pairs) and a web-domain corpus (approx. 150 aligned documents, approx. 2k aligned sentence pairs). In addition, we are building a web harvester and experimenting with automatic alignment methods to facilitate the integration of non-aligned and to be published parallel documents. Using this approach, we are dynamically increasing the webdomain corpus, so it is currently extended to approx. 750 document pairs and approx. 3.5k aligned sentence pairs. We show that using DEPLAIN to train a transformer-based seq2seq text simplification model can achieve promising results.

In Europe, the attempts to ensure trustworthy AI started already with the High-Level Expert Group Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI and have now merged into the regulatory discourse on the EU AI Act. Around the globe, policymakers are actively pursuing initiatives-as the US Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI, or the Bletchley Declaration on AI showcase-based on the premise that the right regulatory strategy can shape trust in AI. To analyze the validity of this premise, we propose to consider the broader literature on trust in automation. On this basis, we constructed a framework to analyze 16 factors that impact trust in AI and automation more broadly. We analyze the interplay between these factors and disentangle them to determine the impact regulation can have on each. The article thus provides policymakers and legal scholars with a foundation to gauge different regulatory strategies, notably by differentiating between those strategies where regulation is more likely to also influence trust on AI (e.g., regulating the types of tasks that AI may fulfill) and those where its influence on trust is more limited (e.g., measures that increase awareness of complacency and automation biases). Our analysis underscores the critical role of nuanced regulation in shaping the human-automation relationship and offers a targeted approach to policymakers to debate how to streamline regulatory efforts for future AI governance.","2024-07","2024-10-27 16:08:24","2024-10-27 16:08:24","","780-801","","3","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001111291000001","","","","","","","artificial intelligence; AUTOMATION; ATTITUDES; trust; ANTHROPOMORPHISM; automation; COMPUTERS; human-automation trust; METAANALYSIS; OVERTRUST; PROPENSITY; regulation of technology; ROBOT; STRATEGIES; TRUSTWORTHINESS; trustworthy AI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lately, the use of ADM systems across various fields, ranging from public to private, from criminal justice to credit scoring, has given rise to concerns about the negative consequences that data-driven technologies have in reinforcing and reinterpreting existing societal biases. This development has led to growing demand for ethical AI, often perceived to require human control over automation. By engaging in discussions of human-computer interaction and in post-structural policy analysis, I examine EU policy proposals to address the problematizations of AI through human oversight. I argue that the relevant policy documents do not reflect the results of earlier research which have undeniably demonstrated the shortcomings of human control over automation, which in turn leads to the reproduction of the harmful dichotomy of human versus machine in EU policy. Despite its shortcomings, the emphasis on human oversight reflects broader fears surrounding loss of control, framed as ethical concerns around digital technologies. Critical examination of these fears reveals an inherent connection between human agency and the legitimacy of legal decision-making that socio-legal scholarship needs to address.","2020","2024-10-27 16:08:24","2024-10-27 16:08:24","","9-46","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000567158400002","","","","","","","AI ethics; legal theory; oversight; automation; algorithmic governance; EU law; human control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But given AI's twin capacity to cause and cure error, bias, and inequity, there is little consensus about how to regulate its use. This review advances debate by lifting up research at the intersection of computer science, organizational behavior, and law. First, pushing past the usual catalogs of algorithmic harms and benefits, we argue that what makes government AI most concerning is its steady advance into discretion-laden policy spaces where we have long tolerated less-than-full legal accountability. The challenge is how, but also whether, to fortify existing public law paradigms without hamstringing government or stymieing useful innovation. Second, we argue that sound regulation must connect emerging knowledge about internal agency practices in designing and implementing AI systems to longer-standing lessons about the limits of external legal constraints in inducing organizations to adopt desired practices.

Part II describes how AI is transforming what it means to provide legal services in six primary areas: litigation review; expertise automation; legal research; contract analytics; contract and litigation document generation; and predictive analytics. Part III explores who are the providers of these AI driven legal services - often non-lawyer legal service providers - and how these providers are replacing at least some of what clients have traditionally sought from lawyers. Part III also discusses the implications of all these changes both for the future role of lawyers individually, and in particular what services will clients still need lawyers to perform: judgment, empathy, creativity and adaptability.

Moreover, the emergence of AI-generated liability, and enforcement mechanisms. Discriminatory practices and trade barriers fueled by AI-driven automation and predictive analytics threaten market access and fair competition. Harmonising regulatory approaches to AI governance is imperative to promote interoperability, innovation, and market integration. Despite these challenges, AI offers significant opportunities to enhance trade facilitation, efficiency, and dispute resolution mechanisms. Embracing AI technologies can streamline supply chains, reduce transaction costs, and expedite customs offer innovative solutions to resolve trade disputes promptly and efficiently.

Mineral development, if governed by appropriate legal frameworks, is key to facilitating development in Africa. With this realization, the African Union (AU) adopted the Africa Mining Vision (AMV) in 2009, which aims to prioritize African industrialization, safeguard the environment, build and utilize local labor force capacity, facilitate transparency, and improve revenue-sharing mechanisms in Africa. However, at the same time, the dawn of artificial intelligence (AI) and complex levels of automation is making quick inroads into the mineral development sector. This article argues that, in response to the AMV, over half of Africa's governments enacted a new generation of laws that seek to maximize the retention of mining benefits within the country. Focusing on labor-related local content provisions of these laws as an example, it highlights the inclusion or enhancement of provisions on local content aimed at building and utilizing local labor force capacity to address employment challenges in these countries. It concludes that because these reforms do not envisage the dawn of advanced automation, the elements of the law that aim to address growing unemployment may already be ineffective on arrival. Local content provisions on labor speak to the need to hire locally with due attention to efficiency and economy. However, they are in tension with automation, which is also aimed at improving efficiency, economy, and safety, thus quashing the push for increases in local labor force numbers before it can materialize. Closer and specific engagement between industry and government, for example, through collaborative multi-stakeholder sector-planning commissions, is necessary to plan for the impact of automation, and a reframing of local content may be necessary to ensure that the sector's legal framework is responsive to the realities of automation.","2019-01","2024-10-27 16:08:24","2024-10-27 16:08:24","","137-156","","1","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000468813200004","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tax administrations employ AI systems for various tasks, from risk detection to legal analysis. While automation offers efficiency, there are also risks, such as violations of fundamental rights and discrimination, illustrated by examples like the Dutch childcare benefits scandal. It deals with two relevant EU regulations, namely the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the proposed European AI regulation (AI Act), emphasizing the need for more clarity and protection for taxpayers. The GDPR imposes a principled ban on fully automated decisions but allows exceptions if appropriate measures are in place. The AI Act introduces a right to human intervention for high-risk AI systems, but the author argues that the regulations are not clear enough, especially in view of the upcoming 'tax administration 3.0' model of the OECD further reducing human intervention.

"DCHM92TW","journalArticle","2023","Kaminski, ME","REGULATING THE RISKS OF AI","BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW","","0006-8047","","","Companies and governments now use Artificial Intelligence (""AI"") in a wide range of settings. But using AI leads to well-known risks that arguably present challenges for a traditional liability model. It is thus unsurprising that lawmakers in both the United States and the European Union (""EU"") have turned to the tools of risk regulation in governing AI systems. This Article describes the growing convergence around risk regulation in AI governance. It then addresses the question: what does it mean to use risk regulation to govern AI systems? The primary contribution of this Article is to offer an analytic framework for understanding the use of risk regulation as AI governance. It aims to surface the shortcomings of risk regulation as a legal approach, and to enable readers to identify which type of risk regulation is at play in a given law. The theoretical contribution of this Article is to encourage researchers to think about what is gained and what is lost by choosing a particular legal tool for constructing the meaning of AI systems in the law. Whatever the value of using risk regulation, constructing AI harms as risks is a choice with consequences. Risk regulation comes with its own policy baggage: a set of tools and troubles that have emerged in other fields. Risk regulation tends to try to fix problems with the technology so it may be used, rather than contemplating that it might sometimes not be appropriate to use it at all. Risk regulation works best on quantifiable problems and struggles with hard-to -quantify harms. It can cloak what are really policy decisions as technical decisions. Risk regulation typically is not structured to make injured people whole. And the version of risk regulation typically deployed to govern AI systems lacks the feedback loops of tort liability. Thus the choice to use risk regulation in the first place channels the law towards a particular approach to AI governance that makes implicit tradeoffs and carries predictable shortcomings. The second, more granular observation this Article makes is that not all risk regulation is the same. That is, once regulators choose to deploy risk regulation, there are still significant variations in what type of risk regulation they might use. Risk regulation is a legal transplant with multiple possible origins. This Article identifies at least four models for AI risk regulation that meaningfully diverge in how they address accountability.","2023-09","2024-10-27 16:08:24","2024-10-27 16:08:24","","1347-1411","","5","103","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001107494700001","","","","","","","AUTOMATION; COMPLACENCY; ACCOUNTABILITY; BIAS; LESSONS; ALGORITHM; COST-BENEFIT; MANAGEMENT; PRIVACY; SAFETY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We demonstrate the shortcomings of conventional ex ante and ex post review under current administrative law doctrines and then consider how those doctrines might adapt in response. Finally, we ask how else to build a sensible accountability structure around public sector use of algorithmic governance tools while maintaining incentives and opportunities for salutary innovation. Reviewing some commonly offered solutions, we propose a further and novel approach to oversight centered on prospective benchmarking. By requiring agencies to reserve a random set of cases for manual decision making, benchmarking offers a concrete and accessible test of the validity and legality of machine outputs, enabling agencies, courts, and the public to learn about, validate, and correct errors in algorithmic decision making.","2020","2024-10-27 16:08:25","2024-10-27 16:08:25","","800-854","","3","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000567989300001","","","","","","","GOVERNMENT; AUTOMATION; DECISION-MAKING; BIAS; TRANSPARENCY; ADJUDICATION; ARBITRARINESS; LITIGATION; PUBLIC REGULATION; SEPARATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that once law and code are understood as material entities that intra-act through in-formation, the concept of transduction allows us to trace how they push each other towards change.

According to official Chinese discourse, smart court reform is supposed to make the justice system 'fairer'. However, research has not yet clearly established how 'fairness' and automation are connected in the Chinese context. This article is interested in how smart court and automation fit into Chinese interpretations of 'fairness'. Therefore, we ask what notions of 'fairness' drive and justify smart court reform? The main argument is that SCR allegedly reinforces elements of procedural fairness, i.e., internal accountability, external visibility, and due process in a way that they are conducive to substantive goals of legitimation, social stability, and user convenience. Most noteworthy, there is a strong emphasis on procedural consistency. This article conducts a systematic qualitative analysis of the foundational texts and discourse about smart courts in China, such as judicial policy documents, development and reform plans, white papers, and regulations. In our analysis we find that smart courts promote procedural and substantive components of 'fairness' that strengthen legal rationality while keeping open channels of control. Our findings help explain the rapid embrace of automation and technology in China's justice administration: they fit perfectly within the ruling party's worldview and perpetuate it in turn.","2023-11","2024-10-27 16:08:25","2024-10-27 16:08:25","","","","","51","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001112029800001","","","","","","","LAW; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; Justice; PARTY; Automation; ACCESS; China; Fairness; Smart courts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an incentive to technological innovation and to reap the benefits of investment, it is essential to own and protect the Intellectual Property in all innovations. The ownership of intangible aspects of software innovation and protection of the data that forms part thereof, is a difficult question, the answer to which still remains behind a smokescreen. Different IP protection mechanisms recognized under various international documents are examined in this research for exploring the better and effective protection for AI and AI-based inventions. Protection of data is an important aspect and critical component of AI as its functioning mechanism is based upon machine learning techniques that use data for training and validation. With this research the authors paint a picture of the various difficulties encountered while looking for effective data protection measures. This research is an attempt to assess the efficiency of IP laws for protection of the data which forms part of AI technology, when the same is made the 'subject' of digital trade.

The focus lies on artificial-intelligence-driven tools and technologies employed, whether at pre-investigation stages or within criminal proceedings, in order to decode human behaviour and facilitate decision-making as to whom to investigate, arrest, prosecute, and eventually punish. In this context, this article first underlines the existence of a persistent dilemma between the goal of increasing the operational efficiency of police and judicial authorities and that of safeguarding fundamental rights of the affected individuals. Subsequently, it shifts the focus onto key principles of criminal procedure and the presumption of innocence in particular. Using Article 6 ECHR and the Directive (EU) 2016/343 as a starting point, it discusses challenges relating to the protective scope of presumption of innocence, the burden of proof rule and the in dubio pro reo principle as core elements of it. Given the transformations law enforcement and criminal proceedings go through in the era of algorithms, big data and artificial intelligence, this article advocates the adoption of specific procedural safeguards that will uphold rule of law requirements, and particularly transparency, fairness and explainability. In doing so, it also takes into account EU legislative initiatives, including the reform of the EU data protection acquis, the E-evidence Proposal, and the Proposal for an EU AI Act.

"VPZFDAHD","journalArticle","2024","Frost, N","The Impoverished Publicness of Algorithmic Decision Making","OXFORD JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES","","0143-6503","10.1093/ojls/gqae027","","The increasing use of machine learning (ML) in public administration requires that we think carefully about the political and legal constraints imposed on public decision making. These developments confront us with the following interrelated questions: can algorithmic public decisions be truly 'public'? And, to what extent does the use of ML models compromise the 'publicness' of such decisions? This article is part of a broader inquiry into the myriad ways in which digital and AI technologies transform the fabric of our democratic existence by mutating the 'public'. Focusing on the site of public administration, the article develops a conception of publicness that is grounded in a view of public administrations as communities of practice. These communities operate through dialogical, critical and synergetic interactions that allow them to track-as faithfully as possible-the public's heterogeneous view of its interests, and reify these interests in decision making. Building on this theorisation, the article suggests that the use of ML models in public decision making inevitably generates an impoverished publicness, and thus undermines the potential of public administrations to operate as a locus of democratic construction. The article thus advocates for a reconsideration of the ways in which administrative law problematises and addresses the harms of algorithmic decision making.","2024-08-10","2024-10-27 16:08:25","2024-10-27 16:08:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001288229000001","","","","","","","LAW; machine learning; artificial intelligence; administrative law; AUTOMATION; BIAS; public administration; TRANSPARENCY; law & technology; PREDICTION; public decision making","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet judges are confronting machine learning algorithms with increasing frequency, including in criminal, administrative, and civil cases. This Essay argues that judges should demand explanations for these algorithmic outcomes. One way to address the ""black box"" problem is to design systems that explain how the algorithms reach their conclusions or predic lions. If and as judges demand these explanations, they will play a seminal role in shaping the nature and form of ""explainable AI"" (xAI). Using the tools of the common law, courts can develop what xAI should mean in different legal contexts. There are advantages to having courts to play this role: Judicial reasoning that builds from the bottom up, using case-by-case consideration of the facts to produce nuanced decisions, is a pragmatic way to develop rules for xAI. Further, courts are likely to stimulate the production of different forms of xAI that are responsive to distinct legal settings and audiences. More generally, we should favor the greater involvement of public actors in shaping xAI, which to date has largely been left in private hands.","2019-11","2024-10-27 16:08:25","2024-10-27 16:08:25","","1829-1850","","7","119","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000505471500006","","","","","","","AUTOMATION; EXPLANATION; DECISION-MAKING; BIAS; COMMON-LAW","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digitalisation is outpacing the evolution of the legal framework. Despite several strands of international efforts to adjust good administration guarantees to new modes of digital public governance, progress has so far been slow and tepid. The increasing automation of decision-making processes puts significant pressure on traditional good administration guarantees, jeopardises individual due process rights, and risks eroding public trust. Automated decision-making has, so far, attracted the bulk of scholarly attention, especially in the European context. However, most analyses seek to reconcile existing duties towards individuals under the right to good administration with the challenges arising from digitalisation. Taking a critical and technology-centred doctrinal approach to developments under the law of the European Union and the Council of Europe, this paper goes beyond current debates to challenge the sufficiency of existing good administration duties. By stressing the mass effects that can derive from automated decision-making by the public sector, the paper advances the need to adapt good administration guarantees to a collective dimension through an extension and a broadening of the public sector's good administration duties: that is, through an extended ex ante control of organisational risk-taking, and a broader ex post duty of automated redress. These legal modifications should be urgently implemented.","2024-02","2024-10-27 16:08:25","2024-10-27 16:08:25","","","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001168252300001","","","","","","","ALGORITHM; automated decision-making; automated redress; collective interests; digitalisation; EU LAW; good administration; mass effects; organisational risk-taking; public sector; public trust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The requirement to take precautions against the effects of attack requires the defender to minimize the risk that civilians and civilian objects will be harmed by enemy military operations. At its most basic, it obliges defenders to locate military installations away from civilians. Furthermore, where appropriate, the status of objects should be clearly marked. It is - somewhat counterintuitively - about making it easier for the attacker to select lawful targets by making visible the distinction between civilian objects and military objectives. The increasing importance of digital infrastructure to modern life may make complying with these precautionary obligations more complicated. Maintaining separation between military and civilian networks is challenging as both operate using at least some of the same infrastructure, relying on the same cables, systems, and electromagnetic spectrum. In addition, the speed at which operations against digital infrastructure can occur increases the difficulty of complying with the obligation - particularly if such operations involve a degree of automation or the use of artificial intelligence (AI). This paper sets out the source and extent of the obligation to take precautions against hostile military operations and considers how they might apply to digital infrastructure. As well as clarifying the extent of the obligation, it applies the obligation to take precautions against hostile military operations to digital infrastructure, giving examples of where systems designers are taking these obligations into account, and other examples of where they must.","2021-12","2024-10-27 16:08:25","2024-10-27 16:08:25","","224-250","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000733322700004","","","","","","","ATTACK; international humanitarian law; military operations; precautions; precautions against attack; URBAN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In considering its future direction, this article contemplates various perspectives regarding the purpose of legal education, and the pressures that may be brought to bear on pedagogical practices as a result of current and emerging technologies. Situating these considerations within the broader commentary regarding the future of work and the role of human beings in an age of automation, this article argues that the nature and type of skills taught to future lawyers, as well as the substantive knowledge relevant in the 21st century, will depend upon the irreducible value of human beings to the law and legal processes. Tasks that require creativity, complex reasoning or social intelligence (such as the ability to negotiate complex social relationships effectively) will remain the province of human beings. This must inform and shape legal education. Consequently, this article argues that the future of legal education is one that recognises lawyers will increasingly be required to attain a broad, liberal education enabling interdisciplinary insights, creativity and social intelligence.","2020","2024-10-27 16:08:25","2024-10-27 16:08:25","","243-265","","1","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000558661200008","","","","","","","AGE; MOOCS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We consider a variety of approaches, including dynamic few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and zero-shot prompting. While we achieve results with GPT-3 that are better than the previous best published results, we also identify several types of clear errors it makes. We investigate why these errors happen. We discover that GPT-3 has imperfect prior knowledge of the actual U.S. statutes on which SARA is based. More importantly, we create simple synthetic statutes, which GPT-3 is guaranteed not to have seen during training. We find GPT-3 performs poorly at answering straightforward questions about these simple synthetic statutes.","2023","2024-10-27 16:12:06","2024-10-27 16:30:18","","22-31","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001139079400003","","","","","","","GPT-3; law; natural language processing; reasoning; statutes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PROCEEDINGS OF THE 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW, ICAIL 2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The article deploys a form of computational natural language processing, using a large-language model machine learning process (GPT-3) to extract data from online Federal Court dockets. The article reviews patterns in outcomes in thousands of stay of removal applications identified through this process and reveals a wide range in stay grant rates across many justices. The article argues that the Federal Court should take measures to encourage more consistency in stay decision-making and cautions against relying heavily on stays of removal to ensure that deportation complies with constitutional procedural justice protections. The article is also a demonstration of how machine learning can be used to pursue empirical legal research projects that would have been cost prohibitive or technically challenging only a few years ago-and shows how technology that is increasingly used to enhance the power of the state at the expense of marginalized migrants can instead be used to scrutinize legal decision-making in the immigration law field, hopefully in ways that enhance the rights of migrants.

In the realm of legal document composition, a pivotal component revolves around accurately referencing case laws and other sources to substantiate assertions and arguments. Understanding the legal domain and identifying appropriate citation context or cite-worthy sentences automatically is challenging. Our research is centered on the issue of citation-worthiness identification of a given sentence. This serves as the initial phase in contemporary citation recommendation systems, aimed at alleviating the effort involved in extracting a suitable array of citation contexts. To address this, we first introduce a labeled dataset comprising 178 million sentences, specifically tailored for detecting citation-worthy content within the legal domain. This dataset is curated from the Caselaw Access Project (CAP)(2) (https://case.law/). We proceeded to assess the performance of a range of deep learning models on this novel dataset. Among the models examined, the domain-specific pre-trained model consistently demonstrated superior performance, achieving an 88% F1-score in the task of detecting citation-worthy material. To enhance our insights, we employed inputXGradient explainable AI techniques to dissect the predictions, thereby identifying the tokens that contribute to specific citation classes.","2023","2024-10-27 16:12:43","2024-10-27 16:30:20","","257-262","","","379","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001175464100031","","","","","","","Citation; Classification; Legal NLP","","Spanakis, J; VanDijck, G; Sileno, G","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LEGAL KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The variety of exceptional measures adopted in countries characterized by different legal systems and natural languages, as well as the rapid evolution of such measures, pose considerable challenges to manual textual analysis methods traditionally used in the social sciences. To address these challenges, we develop a supervised classifier to support the manual coding of exceptional policies by a multinational team of human coders. After presenting the results of various natural language processing (NLP) experiments, we show that human-in-the-loop approaches to computational text analysis outperform unsupervised approaches in accurately extracting policy events from legal texts.

While data or information are not subject matter within copyright law, almost all materials used to construct corpora for machine learning are protected by copyright law: texts, images, videos, and so on. There are global policy moves to address the copyright implications of machine learning, in particular in the context of so-called ""foundation models"" that underpin generative AI. This paper takes a step back, exploring empirically three technological settings through detailed case studies. We set out the established industry methodology of a lifecycle of AI (collecting data, organising data, model training, model operation) to arrive at descriptions suitable for legal analysis. This will allow an assessment of the challenges for a harmonisation of rights, exceptions and disclosure under EU copyright law. The three case studies are:Machine learning for scientific purposes, in the context of a study of regional short-term letting markets;Natural Language Processing (NLP), in the context of large language models;Computer vision, in the context of content moderation of images.We find that the nature and quality of data corpora at the input stage is central to the lifecycle of machine learning. Because of the uncertain legal status of data collection and processing, combined with the competitive advantage gained by firms not disclosing technological advances, the inputs of the models deployed are often unknown. Moreover, the ""lawful access"" requirement of the EU exception for text and data mining may turn the exception into a decision by rightholders to allow machine learning in the context of their decision to allow access. We assess policy interventions at EU level, seeking to clarify the legal status of input data via copyright exceptions, opt-outs or the forced disclosure of copyright materials. We find that the likely result is a fully copyright-licensed environment of machine learning that may have problematic effects for the structure of industry, innovation and scientific research.","2024-01","2024-10-27 16:13:26","2024-10-27 16:30:27","","110-138","","1","55","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001155789200001","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Copyright; Data mining; Digital single market; EU; TEXT; Text mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has the potential to form the basis for further transformation of the national model of justice.
