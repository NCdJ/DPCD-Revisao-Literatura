This paper begins by investigating the methodological challenges in documenting and verifying the 90th-percentile claim, presenting four sets of findings that indicate that OpenAI's estimates of GPT-4's UBE percentile are overinflated. First, although GPT-4's UBE score nears the 90th percentile when examining approximate conversions from February administrations of the Illinois Bar Exam, these estimates are heavily skewed towards repeat test-takers who failed the July administration and score significantly lower than the general test-taking population. Second, data from a recent July administration of the same exam suggests GPT-4's overall UBE percentile was below the 69th percentile, and similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 48th percentile on essays. Third, examining official NCBE data and using several conservative statistical assumptions, GPT-4's performance against first-time test takers is estimated to be similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 62nd percentile, including similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 42nd percentile on essays. Fourth, when examining only those who passed the exam (i.e. licensed or license-pending attorneys), GPT-4's performance is estimated to drop to similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 48th percentile overall, and similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 15th percentile on essays. In addition to investigating the validity of the percentile claim, the paper also investigates the validity of GPT-4's reported scaled UBE score of 298. The paper successfully replicates the MBE score, but highlights several methodological issues in the grading of the MPT + MEE components of the exam, which call into question the validity of the reported essay score. Finally, the paper investigates the effect of different hyperparameter combinations on GPT-4's MBE performance, finding no significant effect of adjusting temperature settings, and a significant effect of few-shot chain-of-thought prompting over basic zero-shot prompting. Taken together, these findings carry timely insights for the desirability and feasibility of outsourcing legally relevant tasks to AI models, as well as for the importance for AI developers to implement rigorous and transparent capabilities evaluations to help secure safe and trustworthy AI.","2024-03-30","2024-10-27 16:07:35","2024-10-27 16:30:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001194581100001","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence and law; LAW; Law and technology; Legal analytics; Legal NLP; Legal profession; Machine learning; Natural language processing; NLP","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, detecting sentence boundaries within legal texts poses a unique and challenging problem due to their distinct structural and linguistic features. Our approach utilizes deep learning models to leverage delimiter and surrounding context information as input, enabling precise detection of sentence boundaries in English legal texts. We evaluate various deep learning models, including domain-specific transformer models like LegalBERT and CaseLawBERT. To assess the efficacy of our deep learning models, we compare them with a state-of-the-art domain-specific statistical conditional random field (CRF) model. After considering model size, F1-score, and inference time, we identify the Convolutional Neural Network Model (CNN) as the top-performing deep learning model. To further enhance performance, we integrate the features of the CNN model into the subsequent CRF model, creating a hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of both models. Our experiments demonstrate that the hybrid model outperforms the baseline model, achieving a 4% improvement in the F1-score. Additional experiments showcase the superiority of the hybrid model over SBD open-source libraries when confronted with an out-of-domain test set. These findings underscore the importance of efficient SBD in legal texts and emphasize the advantages of employing deep learning models and hybrid architectures to achieve optimal performance.","2024-03-14","2024-10-27 16:11:53","2024-10-27 16:11:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001182938300001","","","","","","","Natural language processing; Deep learning; CaseLawBERT; CNN; CRF; LegalBERT; Sentence boundary detection; Transformer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in legal domains, due to the complexity, length, and sparsity of legal case documents, the use of these advanced NLP techniques has offered comparatively slight returns. Perhaps even more importantly, such methods are critically lacking in explainability and justification of outputs, which are essential for many legal applications. We propose that the direction of these NLP techniques should be aimed at ascription to a legal knowledge model, which can then provide the necessary and auditable justifications for the rationale of any case outcome. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of using Hierarchical Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (H-BERT) models to ascribe to an Angelic Domain Model (ADM) that is able to represent the legal knowledge of a domain in a structured way, enabling justifications and improving performance. Our study involved an annotation task on a popular domain, cases from the European Court of Human Rights, to gain an understanding of the balance of complaints in the domain. The data set produced from this study enabled training of models for factor ascription using the classification targets derived from the annotations. We present results of experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of the ascription task at three different levels of abstraction within the structured model.","2023","2024-10-27 16:11:53","2024-10-27 16:30:23","","167-176","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001139079400018","","","","","","","case annotation; domain model; factor ascription; Transformers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PROCEEDINGS OF THE 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW, ICAIL 2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Discussions of potential uses (e.g., document drafting, summarization) of this emerging technology in legal domain have intensified, but to date there has not been a rigorous analysis of these large language models' (LLM) capacity in sentence-level semantic annotation of legal texts in zero-shot learning settings. Yet, this particular type of use could unlock many practical applications (e.g., in contract review) and research opportunities (e.g., in empirical legal studies). We fill the gap with this study. We examined if and how successfully the model can semantically annotate small batches of short text snippets (10-50) based exclusively on concise definitions of the semantic types. We found that the GPT model performs surprisingly well in zero-shot settings on diverse types of documents (F-1 =.73 on a task involving court opinions, .86 for contracts, and .54 for statutes and regulations). These findings can be leveraged by legal scholars and practicing lawyers alike to guide their decisions in integrating LLMs in wide range of workflows involving semantic annotation of legal texts.","2023","2024-10-27 16:12:05","2024-10-27 16:12:05","","447-451","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001139079400053","","","","","","","adjudicatory; DECISIONS; EXTRACTION; generative pre-trained transformers; GPT; Semantic legal annotation; transfer learning; zero-shot","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PROCEEDINGS OF THE 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW, ICAIL 2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the ""unseen test set"", the Insolvency Bot based on gpt-3.5-turbo outperformed gpt-3.5-turbo (p = 1.8%), and our gpt-4 based bot outperformed unmodified gpt-4 (p = 0.05%). These promising results can be expanded to cross-jurisdictional queries and be further improved by matching on-point legal information to user queries. Overall, they demonstrate the importance of incorporating trusted knowledge sources into traditional LLMs in answering domain-specific queries.","2023","2024-10-27 16:12:05","2024-10-27 16:12:05","","305-310","","","379","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001175464100039","","","","","","","NLP; prompt engineering; chatbot; insolvency law (England); legal tech; LLMs (GPT)","","Spanakis, J; VanDijck, G; Sileno, G","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LEGAL KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this is still a challenging task for long documents, since it is difficult for a model to identify the most relevant information for classification. In this paper, we propose a two-stage supervised learning approach for the classification of petitions, a type of legal document that requests a court order. The proposed approach is based on a word-level encoder-decoder Seq2Seq deep neural network, such as a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) or a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, and a document-level Support Vector Machine classifier. To address the challenges posed by the lengthy legal documents, the approach introduces a human-in-the-loop approach, whose task is to localize and tag relevant segments of text in the word-level training part, which dramatically reduces the dimension of the document classifier input vector. We performed experiments to validate our approach using a real-world dataset comprised of 270 intermediate petitions, which were carefully annotated by specialists from the 15th civil unit of the State of Alagoas, Brazil. Our results revealed that both BiLSTM and BERT-Convolutional Neural Networks variants achieved an accuracy of up to 95.49%, and also outperformed baseline classifiers based on the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency test vectorizer. The proposed approach is currently being utilized to automate the aforementioned justice unit, thereby increasing its efficiency in handling repetitive tasks.","2023-12-15","2024-10-27 16:12:06","2024-10-27 16:12:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001129156000001","","","","","","","Deep learning; BERT; BiLSTM; Legal document classification; SVM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, empirical research on their effectiveness in conducting legal tasks is scant. We study securities cases involving cryptocurrencies as one of numerous contexts where AI could support the legal process, studying GPT-3.5's legal reasoning and ChatGPT's legal drafting capabilities. We examine whether a) GPT-3.5 can accurately determine which laws are potentially being violated from a fact pattern, and b) whether there is a difference in juror decision-making based on complaints written by a lawyer compared to ChatGPT. We feed fact patterns from real-life cases to GPT-3.5 and evaluate its ability to determine correct potential violations from the scenario and exclude spurious violations. Second, we had mock jurors assess complaints written by ChatGPT and lawyers. GPT-3.5's legal reasoning skills proved weak, though we expect improvement in future models, particularly given the violations it suggested tended to be correct (it merely missed additional, correct violations). ChatGPT performed better at legal drafting, and jurors' decisions were not statistically significantly associated with the author of the document upon which they based their decisions. Because GPT-3.5 cannot satisfactorily conduct legal reasoning tasks, it would be unlikely to be able to help lawyers in a meaningful way at this stage. However, ChatGPT's drafting skills (though, perhaps, still inferior to lawyers) could assist lawyers in providing legal services.

The incorporation of these tools can improve the analysis of the text of the proposed new laws and speed the preparation and discussion of new laws. The performance of artificial intelligence tools for text processing tasks is largely affected by the corpora used, which should ideally be adapted for the specific domain. When dealing with legislative corpora, text segmentation is often necessary due to the distinct purposes of legislative segments within the overall bill structure. While rule-based approaches can be effective in cases where the data follows a consistent format, they fail when inconsistencies arise in the formatting of legislative bills. In this study, we extensively investigate the use of weak supervision and active learning to accurately segment over 100,000 Brazilian federal legislative bills using a sequence tagging approach. The experiments demonstrated that both BERT and LSTM models achieved high statistical performance without the limitations of rule-based systems. In segmenting long documents beyond the limited context window of BERT, we find that simple moving windows suffice because the required context for accurate legislative segmentation is mostly local. We also conducted an analysis of transfer learning from our monolingual models to French, Italian, German, and English (US) legislative texts. According to our experimental results our models present non-trivial zero-shot and effective out-of-distribution fine-tuning performance, suggesting potential avenues for multilingual legislative segmentation without the need for computationally expensive models.

LoT teaches only that in the legal syllogism the major premise is law, the minor premise is the fact, and the conclusion is judgment. Then the models can produce a syllogism reasoning of the case and give the judgment without any learning, fine-tuning, or examples. On CAIL2018, a Chinese criminal case dataset, we performed zero-shot judgment prediction experiments with GPT-3 models. Our results show that LLMs with LoT achieve better performance than the baseline and chain of thought prompting, the state-of-art prompting method on diverse reasoning tasks.

Unlike information retrieval for general texts, this task is more complex with two phases (legal case retrieval and legal case entailment) and much harder due to a number of reasons. First, both the query and candidate cases are long documents consisting of several paragraphs. This makes it difficult to model with representation learning that usually has restriction on input length. Second, the concept of relevancy in this domain is defined based on the legal relation that goes beyond the lexical or topical relevance. This is a real challenge because normal text matching will not work. Third, building a large and accurate legal case dataset requires a lot of effort and expertise. This is obviously an obstacle to creating enough data for training deep retrieval models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called supporting model that can deal with both phases.

Recognizing AI's significant impact on climate change and its substantial water consumption, especially in large generative models like ChatGPT, GPT-4, or Gemini, the article aims to integrate sustainability considerations into technology regulation, in three steps. First, while current EU environmental law does not directly address these issues, there is potential to reinterpret existing legislation, such as the GDPR, to support sustainability goals. Counterintuitively, the article argues that this also implies the need to balance individual rights, such as the right to erasure, with collective environmental interests. Second, based on an analysis of current law, and the proposed EU AI Act, the article suggests a suite of policy measures to align AI and technology regulation with environmental sustainability. They extend beyond mere transparency mechanisms, such as disclosing greenhouse gas footprints, to include a mix of strategies like co -regulation, sustainability by design, restrictions on training data, and consumption caps, potentially integrating AI and technology more broadly into the EU emissions trading regime. Third, this regulatory toolkit could serve as a blueprint for other technologies with high environmental impacts, such as blockchain and metaverse applications.

One major contribution of this study is the creation of a substantially extended version of the Genocide Transcript Corpus (GTC) that includes 52,845 text segments of transcripts from three different genocide tribunals. Based on this data, we first examine the prevalence of trauma-related content in witness statements. Second, we are implementing a binary classification algorithm to automatically detect potentially traumatic content. Therefore, in a preparatory step, an Active Learning (AL) approach is applied to establish the ideal size for the training data set. Subsequently, this data is used to train a transformer model. In this case, the two models BERTbase and HateBERT are used for both steps, allowing for a comparison of a base-level model with a model that has already been pre-trained on data more relevant in the context of harmful vocabulary. In a third step, the study employs an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) model to gain a deeper understanding of the reasoning behind the model's classifications. Our results suggest that both BERTbase and HateBERT perform comparatively well on this classification task, with no model clearly outperforming the other. The classification outcomes further suggest that a reduced data set size can achieve equally high performance metrics and might be a preferable choice in certain use cases. The results can be used to establish more trauma-informed legal procedures in genocide-related tribunals, including the identification of potentially re-traumatizing examination approaches at an early stage.","2023","2024-10-27 16:12:06","2024-10-27 16:12:06","","257-266","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001139079400027","","","","","","","BERT; classification; genocide; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; trauma; XAI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PROCEEDINGS OF THE 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW, ICAIL 2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The article deploys a form of computational natural language processing, using a large-language model machine learning process (GPT-3) to extract data from online Federal Court dockets. The article reviews patterns in outcomes in thousands of stay of removal applications identified through this process and reveals a wide range in stay grant rates across many justices. The article argues that the Federal Court should take measures to encourage more consistency in stay decision-making and cautions against relying heavily on stays of removal to ensure that deportation complies with constitutional procedural justice protections. The article is also a demonstration of how machine learning can be used to pursue empirical legal research projects that would have been cost prohibitive or technically challenging only a few years ago-and shows how technology that is increasingly used to enhance the power of the state at the expense of marginalized migrants can instead be used to scrutinize legal decision-making in the immigration law field, hopefully in ways that enhance the rights of migrants. The article also contributes to the broader field of computational legal research in Canada by making available to other non-commercial researchers the code used for the project, as well as a dataset of several thousand Federal Court dockets that can be used for future research.","2024","2024-10-27 16:12:06","2024-10-27 16:30:40","","73-126","","2","49","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001245221700003","","","","","","","REFUGEE DETERMINATIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, rule-based expert systems focused on legislation can support laypeople in understanding how legislation applies to them and provide them with helpful context and information. However, the process of analyzing legislation and other sources to encode it in the desired formal representation can be time-consuming and represents a bottleneck in the development of such systems. Here, we investigate to what degree large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, are able to automatically extract structured representations from legislation. We use LLMs to create pathways from legislation, according to the JusticeBot methodology for legal decision support systems, evaluate the pathways and compare them to manually created pathways. The results are promising, with 60% of generated pathways being rated as equivalent or better than manually created ones in a blind comparison. The approach suggests a promising path to leverage the capabilities of LLMs to ease the costly development of systems based on symbolic approaches that are transparent and explainable.","2023","2024-10-27 16:12:06","2024-10-27 16:12:06","","167-176","","","379","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001175464100022","","","","","","","artificial intelligence; large language models; SEARCH; augmented intelligence; legal decision support tools; legal technology; semantic legislation analysis","","Spanakis, J; VanDijck, G; Sileno, G","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LEGAL KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results were far from perfect but begged the question of whether a human author will still be able to compete against artificial intelligence. Leaving aside the Luddites scenario, this paper starts with the premise that human-made art might be more valued than machine-enabled art. However, to be properly valued, machine-enabled and human-made art must be distinguishable-they are not. Indistinguishability creates an asymmetry in information. This leads to a 'lemons problem'-that is, a market erosion of good-quality products (in this scenario, human-made products). Against that background, this paper proposes a solution in light of international law and rules of origin. This paper argues that the lemons problem induces the need for a rule of origin labelling work as either human-made or machine-enabled. Determining human or machine authorship may be dauntingly complex when the artwork owes its existence to both humans and machines. One solution may be to review how the country of origin is identified whenever products are not created in a single location and then to apply, mutatis mutandis, to rules of authorship origin the solutions once identified in the context of geographical origins, that is, the so-called 'substantial transformation test'. In the context of machine-enabled artwork, this test is whether a human edited the machine output and, if so, whether those edits constituted a substantial transformation of the work of art.","2023","2024-10-27 16:12:07","2024-10-27 16:12:07","","24-39","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001000234800003","","","","","","","GPT-3; authorship; large language model; lemons problem; Machine-enabled artworks; rules of origin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet accessibility refers not only to making legal documents available to the public, but also rendering legal information comprehensible to them. A vexing problem in bringing legal information to the public is how to turn formal legal documents such as legislation and judgments, which are often highly technical, to easily navigable and comprehensible knowledge to those without legal education. In this study, we formulate a three-step approach for bringing legal knowledge to laypersons, tackling the issues of navigability and comprehensibility. First, we translate selected sections of the law into snippets (called CLIC-pages), each being a small piece of article that focuses on explaining certain technical legal concept in layperson's terms. Second, we construct a Legal Question Bank, which is a collection of legal questions whose answers can be found in the CLIC-pages. Third, we design an interactive CLIC Recommender. Given a user's verbal description of a legal situation that requires a legal solution, CRec interprets the user's input and shortlists questions from the question bank that are most likely relevant to the given legal situation and recommends their corresponding CLIC pages where relevant legal knowledge can be found. In this paper we focus on the technical aspects of creating an LQB. We show how large-scale pre-trained language models, such as GPT-3, can be used to generate legal questions. We compare machine-generated questions against human-composed questions and find that MGQs are more scalable, cost-effective, and more diversified, while HCQs are more precise. We also show a prototype of CRec and illustrate through an example how our 3-step approach effectively brings relevant legal knowledge to the public.","2024-09","2024-10-27 16:12:07","2024-10-27 16:12:07","","769-805","","3","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001023368400001","","","","","","","Legal knowledge dissemination; Machine question generation; Navigability and comprehensibility of legal information; Pre-trained language model; READABILITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In such systems, information seekers can receive a concise response to their queries by presenting their questions in natural language. Interactive question answering is a recently proposed and increasingly popular solution that resides at the intersection of question answering and dialogue systems. On the one hand, the user can ask questions in normal language and locate the actual response to her inquiry; on the other hand, the system can prolong the question-answering session into a dialogue if there are multiple probable replies, very few, or ambiguities in the initial request.

A particular example of that domain is visual-linguistic tasks, such as visual question answering. The progress of modern machine learning systems is determined, among other things, by the data on which these systems are trained. Most modern visual question answering data sets contain limited type questions that can be answered either by directly accessing the image itself or by using external data. At the same time, insufficient attention is paid to the issues of social interactions between people, which limits the scope of visual question answering systems. In this paper, we propose criteria by which images suitable for social interaction visual question answering can be selected for composing such questions, based on psychological research.

Symbolic processing, performed by the Prolog processing systems which execute unification, resolution, and list operations, is learned by a combination of deep learning models, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Word2Vec training. To our knowledge, the implementation of a Prolog-like processing system using deep learning is a new experiment that has not been conducted in the past. The results of their experiments revealed that the proposed methods are superior to the conventional methods because symbolic processing (1) has rich representations, (2) can interpret inputs even if they include unknown symbols, and (3) can be learned with a small amount of training data. In particular (2), handling of unknown data, which is a major task in artificial intelligence research, is solved using Word2Vec. Furthermore, question answering systems can be built from knowledge bases written in Prolog with learned symbolic processing, which, with conventional methods, is extremely difficult to accomplish. Their proposed systems can not only answer questions through powerful inferences by utilizing facts that harbor unknown data but also have the potential to build knowledge bases from a large amount of data, including unknown data, on the Web. The proposed systems are a completely new trial, there is no state-of-the-art methods in the sense of newest. Therefore, to evaluate their efficiency, they are compared with the most traditional and robust system i.e., the Prolog system. This is new research that encompasses the subjects of conventional artificial intelligence and neural network, and their systems have higher potential to build applications such as FAQ chatbots, decision support systems and energy-efficient estimation using a large amount of information on the Web. Mining hidden information through these applications will provide great value.","2019","2024-10-27 16:12:21","2024-10-27 16:12:21","","152368-152378","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000497163000160","","","","","","","Deep learning; Neural networks; knowledge base; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge discovery; neural machine translation; prolog; question answering system; Reflective binary codes; symbolic processing; Training data; Word2Vec","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms have been widely used in autonomous driving, recommender systems in electronic commerce and social media, fintech, natural language understanding, and question answering systems. Artificial intelligence is also gradually changing the landscape of healthcare research (Yu et al. in Biomed Eng 2:719-731, 25). The rule-based approach that relied on the curation of medical knowledge and the construction of robust decision rules had drawn significant attention in diagnosing diseases and clinical decision support since half a century ago. In recent years, machine learning algorithms such as deep learning that can account for complex interactions between features is shown to be promising in predictive modeling in healthcare (Deo in Circulation 132:1920-1930, 26). Although many of these artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms can achieve remarkably high performance, it is often difficult to be completely adopted in practical clinical environments due to the lack of explainability in some of these algorithms. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is emerging to assist in the communication of internal decisions, behavior, and actions to health care professionals. Through explaining the prediction outcomes, XAI gains the trust of the clinicians as they may learn how to apply the predictive modeling in practical situations instead of blindly following the predictions. There are still many scenarios to explore how to make XAI effective in clinical settings due to the complexity of medical knowledge.","2022-06","2024-10-27 16:12:21","2024-10-27 16:12:21","","228-239","","2","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000754125900001","","","","","","","Explainable artificial intelligence; Healthcare informatics; Human-computer interactions; Predictive modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experimental validation demonstrates the efficacy of this approach in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generated content, particularly in controlling hallucinations and bolstering the output's reliability when processing lengthy text inputs.

MRC is summarized as a task to read a piece of text, understand it, and answer the related question of the text. Reading text can be cloze style reading (fill in the blanks from the text) as well as open style reading (separate question) and understanding the piece of text as well as the query is accomplished by contextual representation and Attention mechanism. In the MRC literature, various methodologies have been used for extracting answers from the given text including primitive methods to the deep learning methods to have a step towards deploying machine intelligence. The introduction of deep learning and large datasets in the recent few years has encouraged the success of MRC.

However, with the advancement of artificial intelligence technology, the emergence of large language models provides a new technological solution to address this issue. Large language models, based on deep learning techniques, have the capability to quickly understand and interpret specialized terminology in the electricity domain through learning from a vast corpus of professional literature and data. They can then be applied to various domains, including question-answering systems. However, existing large language models still face issues of unreliable outputs, necessitating a method to evaluate their results and improve the quality of their applications. We propose a knowledge graph-based credibility evaluation method for electric grid large language model knowledge question-answering. This method aligns the answers generated by large language models with the knowledge graph of a local knowledge base and calculates their cosine similarity and Pearson correlation coefficient. We batch-process the answers from the large language model into an electricity dataset and validate them using this method. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can accurately and efficiently reflect the relevance between texts, providing a reliable scoring basis for question-answering by large models in vertical domains. Future research can focus on exploring other embedding methods that can better extract semantic relationships between texts and validating the feasibility of this method in vertical domains other than electricity.","2023","2024-10-27 16:12:22","2024-10-27 16:12:22","","754-759","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001283896700126","","","","","","","Large Language Models; Knowledge Graph; Electrical Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PROCEEDINGS OF 2023 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRONIC INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING, EITCE 2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, previous scoring-based methods for the multi-choice task suffer from the classification bias problem and can not fully exploit the relationship between reference books, questions, and multi-choice answers. To address the issues, in this paper, we propose a BERT and attention based model for the judicial examination task. Specifically, we first use the BM25 algorithm to retrieve articles in the reference law books to provide certain information to answer a given question. Second, we input a question, its multi-choice answers, and the retrieved relevant articles to BERT for encoding. Third, we input the encoded information to the module of information fuse and match through attention mechanism to find deep relationships in articles, questions, and multi-choice answers. Finally, we concatenate the output of the attention mechanism and input it to a binary classifier to determine whether an answer option to the question is correct.

In recent years, automatic abstractive text summarization has attracted the attention of researchers because large volumes of digital text are readily available in multiple languages on a wide range of topics. Automatically generating precise summaries from large text has potential application in the generation of news headlines, a summary of research articles, the moral of the stories, media marketing, search engine optimization, financial research, social media marketing, question-answering systems, and chatbots. In literature, the problem of abstractive text summarization has been mainly investigated for English and some other languages. However, it has not been thoroughly explored for the Urdu language despite having a huge amount of data available in digital format. To fulfill this gap, this paper presents a large benchmark corpus of 2,067,784 Urdu news articles for the Urdu abstractive text summarization task. As a secondary contribution, we applied a range of deep learning (LSTM, Bi-LSTM, LSTM with attention, GRU, Bi-GRU, and GRU with attention), and large language models (BART and GPT-3.5) on our proposed corpus. Our extensive evaluation on 20,000 test instances showed that GRU with attention model outperforms the other models with ROUGE- 1 = 46.7 , ROUGE- 2 = 24.1 , and ROUGE-L = 48.7.

These systems require a substantial amount of labeled data to train their models. However, the labeled data is scarce and challenging to be constructed. The construction process typically involves two stages: discovering potential sample candidates and manually labeling these candidates. To discover high-quality candidate samples, we study the intention paraphrase template discovery task: Given some seed questions or templates of an intention, discover new paraphrase templates that describe the intention and are diverse to the seeds enough in text. As the first exploration of the task, we identify the new quality requirements, i.e., relevance, divergence and popularity, and identify the new challenges, i.e., the paradox of divergent yet relevant paraphrases, and the conflict of popular yet relevant paraphrases. To untangle the paradox of divergent yet relevant paraphrases, in which the traditional bag of words falls short, we develop usage-centric modeling, which represents a question/template/answer as a bag of usages that users engaged (e.g., up-votes), and uses a usage-flow graph to interrelate templates, questions and answers. To balance the conflict of popular yet relevant paraphrases, we propose a new and principled decomposition for the well-known Pointwise Mutual Information from the usage perspective (usage-PMI), and then develop a Bayesian inference framework over the usage-flow graph to estimate the usage-PMI. Extensive experiments over three large CQA corpora show strong performance advantage over the baselines adopted from paraphrase identification task. We release 885, 000 paraphrase templates of high quality discovered by our proposed PMI decomposition model, and the data is available in site https://github.com/Para-Questions/Intention_template_discovery.","2023","2024-10-27 16:12:22","2024-10-27 16:12:22","","1746-1755","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001161549501082","","","","","","","Bayesian inference; Paraphrasing; Pointwise mutual information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PROCEEDINGS OF THE 32ND ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT, CIKM 2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the advent of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, QA systems have witnessed significant advances. Although DL performs very well on QA, it requires a considerable amount of annotated data for training. Many annotated datasets have been built for the QA task; most of them are exclusively in English. In order to address the need for a high-quality QA dataset in the Persian language, we present PersianQuAD, the native QA dataset for the Persian language. We create PersianQuAD in four steps: 1) Wikipedia article selection, 2) question-answer collection, 3) three-candidates test set preparation, and 4) Data Quality Monitoring. PersianQuAD consists of approximately 20,000 questions and answers made by native annotators on a set of Persian Wikipedia articles. The answer to each question is a segment of the corresponding article text. To better understand PersianQuAD and ensure its representativeness, we analyze PersianQuAD and show it contains questions of varying types and difficulties. We also present three versions of a deep learning-based QA system trained with PersianQuAD. Our best system achieves an F1 score of 82.97% which is comparable to that of QA systems on English SQuAD, made by the Stanford University. This shows that PersianQuAD performs well for training deep-learning-based QA systems. Human performance on PersianQuAD is significantly better (96.49%), demonstrating that PersianQuAD is challenging enough and there is still plenty of room for future improvement.

An intelligent question-answering system was constructed in this research for knowledge management services. It included an entity recognition model based on bidirectional long short-term memory attention conditional random field and a question classification model based on a bidirectional encoder using Transformers text convolutional neural network. The entity recognition model added a reverse long short-term memory propagation structure, while introducing an attention mechanism and conditional random field model. The question classification model utilized a preprocessed structure to output a feature matrix with richer semantic information, while utilizing a bidirectional encoder to extract local features of short text sentences. These experiments confirmed that the constructed model had a high precision of 0.945, which was much higher than other models. The recall of this proposed model was 0.077 higher than the control models. For precision, the proposed model had good recognition performance for methods, files and modules, with values of 0.9040, 0.9050 and 0.9160, respectively. For the recall, the question classification model had the best recognition effect on files, at 0.9060. For the F1-score, the proposed model had the best recognition performance for modules, at 0.9100. The named entity recognition model constructed had high accuracy and F1-score, reaching 0.931 and 0.923, indicating that it had the best classification performance in the dataset. Through intelligent question-answering systems, automatic answering of questions can be achieved, effectively improving knowledge services. This research has integrated knowledge and technology from multiple disciplines such as computer science, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing to promote the cross-integration of these disciplines in knowledge management.

The development of artificial intelligence methods and technologies aimed at speech recognition contributes to the creation of specialised programmes - namely voice assistants - which are capable of conducting a dialogue in natural language. Such services are of particular relevance in inclusive education in order to support students with visual impairments. The research problem lies in the individualised support of students' independent work based on a voice assistant and is determined by the contradiction between the widespread use of various question -answer systems in business and everyday life (including those with a voice interface), on the one hand, and insufficient knowledge their didactic possibilities, on the other hand. Aim. The present research aims to investigate and practically implement the methodology of inclu - sive design of digital educational resources on the example of creating an intelligent voice assistant for students' independent work in the course ""Computer Networks"". Methodology and research methods . The current research is based on the methodology of inclusive design in combination with an ontological approach in relation to the creation of digital educational resources, speech recognition methods, methods for designing intelligent systems and knowledge bases, methods and technologies for designing and implementing automated learning systems with feedback. To recognise questions, search for answers, and support dialogues carried out by a voice assistant, the authors applied natural language text analysis methods and classification models created using machine learning methods. Results. The authors have developed and substantiated the requirements that a digital educational resource must meet in accordance with the principles of inclusive design, linking an ontological approach to content development, automatic individualised support for students, and monitoring the achievement of educational results. According to the formulated requirements, the authors have developed an inter - active computer service - an intelligent voice assistant that provides support for students' independent work when performing practical tasks, using the ""Computer Networks"" course as an example. The service supports voice input and subsequent interpretation of questions, search for answers in the knowledge base with voice output of the result, and implements the execution of operations according to certain rules. Scientific novelty. The authors have clarified the content of the concept of ""inclusive design"" in the context of digital educational resources, when the key feature is the focus on continuous improvement of the didactic capabilities of a particular product.

This massive amount of digital legal documents, combined with the inherent complexity of judiciary systems worldwide, presents a promising scenario for Machine Learning solutions, mainly those taking advantage of all the advancements in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is in this scenario that Jusbrasil, the largest legal tech company in Brazil, is situated. Using a dataset partially curated by the Jusbrasil legal team, we explore topic modeling solutions using state of the art language models, trained with legal Portuguese documents, to automatically organize and summarize this complex collection of documents. Instead of using an entire legal case, which usually is composed of many pages, we show that it is possible to efficiently organize the collection using the syllabus (in Portuguese, ementa jurisprudencial) from each court decision as they concisely summarize the main points presented by the entire decision.","2022","2024-10-27 16:12:43","2024-10-27 16:12:43","","3388-3392","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000852715903060","","","","","","","language models; law tech; legal cases; topic model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PROCEEDINGS OF THE 45TH INTERNATIONAL ACM SIGIR CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL (SIGIR '22)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among the most outstanding findings, we have that the most used data mining techniques are Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) and Random Forest (RF), and in terms of the most used deep learning techniques, we found Long-Term Memory (LSTM) and transformers such as BERT. An important finding in the papers reviewed was that the use of machine learning techniques has prevailed over those of deep learning. Regarding the place of origin of the research carried out, we found that 64% of the works belong to studies carried out in English-speaking countries, 8% in Portuguese and 28% in other languages (such as German, Chinese, Turkish, Spanish, etc.). Very few works of this type have been carried out in Spanish-speaking countries. The classification criteria of the works have been based, on the one hand, on the identification of the classifiers used to predict situations (or events with legal interference) or judicial decisions and, on the other hand, on the application of classifiers to the phenomena regulated by the different branches of law: criminal, constitutional, human rights, administrative, intellectual property, family law, tax law and others. The corpus size analyzed in the reviewed works reached 100,000 documents in 2020. Finally, another important finding lies in the accuracy of these predictive techniques, reaching predictions of over 60% in different branches of law.","2022-10","2024-10-27 16:12:43","2024-10-27 16:12:43","","","","20","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000872322400001","","","","","","","natural language processing; SCIENCE; OUTCOMES; LEGAL; machine learning; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; legal tech; COURT; deep learning; judicial prediction; legal prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we focus on the legal domain, where we explore several approaches for applying BERT models to downstream legal tasks, evaluating on multiple datasets. Our findings indicate that the previous guidelines for pre-training and fine-tuning, often blindly followed, do not always generalize well in the legal domain. Thus we propose a systematic investigation of the available strategies when applying BERT in specialised domains. These are: (a) use the original BERT out of the box, (b) adapt BERT by additional pre-training on domain-specific corpora, and (c) pre-train BERT from scratch on domain-specific corpora.

In the realm of legal document composition, a pivotal component revolves around accurately referencing case laws and other sources to substantiate assertions and arguments. Understanding the legal domain and identifying appropriate citation context or cite-worthy sentences automatically is challenging. Our research is centered on the issue of citation-worthiness identification of a given sentence. This serves as the initial phase in contemporary citation recommendation systems, aimed at alleviating the effort involved in extracting a suitable array of citation contexts. To address this, we first introduce a labeled dataset comprising 178 million sentences, specifically tailored for detecting citation-worthy content within the legal domain. This dataset is curated from the Caselaw Access Project (CAP)(2) (https://case.law/). We proceeded to assess the performance of a range of deep learning models on this novel dataset. Among the models examined, the domain-specific pre-trained model consistently demonstrated superior performance, achieving an 88% F1-score in the task of detecting citation-worthy material. To enhance our insights, we employed inputXGradient explainable AI techniques to dissect the predictions, thereby identifying the tokens that contribute to specific citation classes.","2023","2024-10-27 16:12:43","2024-10-27 16:30:20","","257-262","","","379","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001175464100031","","","","","","","Citation; Classification; Legal NLP","","Spanakis, J; VanDijck, G; Sileno, G","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LEGAL KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
