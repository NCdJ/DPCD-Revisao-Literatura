AB  - Machine learning (ML) has succeeded in improving our daily routines by enabling automation and improved decision making in a variety of industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, resulting in increased efficiency and production. However, the development and widespread use of this technology has been significantly hampered by concerns about data privacy, confidentiality, and sensitivity, particularly in healthcare and finance. The "data hunger" of ML describes how additional data can increase performance and accuracy, which is why this question arises. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a technology that helps solve the privacy problem by eliminating the need to send data to a primary server and collect it where it is processed and the model is trained. To maintain privacy and improve model performance, FL shares parameters rather than data during training, in contrast to the typical ML practice of sending user data during model development. Although FL is still in its infancy, there are already applications in various industries such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and others. In addition, 32% of companies have implemented or plan to implement federated learning in the next 12-24 months, according to the latest figures from KPMG, which forecasts an increase in investment in this area from USD 107 million in 2020 to USD 538 million in 2025. In this context, this article reviews federated learning, describes it technically, differentiates it from other technologies, and discusses current FL aggregation algorithms. It also discusses the use of FL in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Finally, the problems hindering progress in this area and future strategies to overcome these limitations are discussed in detail.

TI  - Echo state graph neural networks with analogue random resistive memory arrays

KW  - CLASSIFICATION
AB  - Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in learning representations of graph-structured data, with applications from social networks to drug discovery. However, graph neural networks, the machine learning models for handling graph-structured data, face significant challenges when running on conventional digital hardware, including the slowdown of Moore's law due to transistor scaling limits and the von Neumann bottleneck incurred by physically separated memory and processing units, as well as a high training cost. Here we present a hardware-software co-design to address these challenges, by designing an echo state graph neural network based on random resistive memory arrays, which are built from low-cost, nanoscale and stackable resistors for efficient in-memory computing. This approach leverages the intrinsic stochasticity of dielectric breakdown in resistive switching to implement random projections in hardware for an echo state network that effectively minimizes the training complexity thanks to its fixed and random weights. The system demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both graph classification using the MUTAG and COLLAB datasets and node classification using the CORA dataset, achieving 2.16x, 35.42x and 40.37x improvements in energy efficiency for a projected random resistive memory-based hybrid analogue-digital system over a state-of-the-art graphics processing unit and 99.35%, 99.99% and 91.40% reductions of backward pass complexity compared with conventional graph learning. The results point to a promising direction for next-generation artificial intelligence systems for graph learning.
   Co-designing hardware platforms and neural network software can help improve the computational efficiency and training affordability of deep learning implementations. A new approach designed for graph learning with echo state neural networks makes use of in-memory computing with resistive memory and shows up to a 35 times improvement in the energy efficiency and 99% reduction in training cost for graph classification on large datasets.

AB  - Objective: Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to perform cognitive and intellectual human tasks. In dentistry, AI offers the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, improve patient outcomes and streamline workflows. The present study provides a framework and a checklist to evaluate AI applications in dentistry from this perspective.Methods: Lending from existing guidance documents, an initial draft of the checklist and an explanatory paper were derived and discussed among the groups members.Results: The checklist was consented to in an anonymous voting process by 29 Topic Group Dental Diagnostics and Digital Dentistry, ITU/WHO Focus Group AI on Health's members. Overall, 11 principles were identified (diversity, transparency, wellness, privacy protection, solidarity, equity, prudence, law and governance, sustainable development, accountability, and responsibility, respect of autonomy, decision-making).Conclusions: Providers, patients, researchers, industry, and other stakeholders should consider these principles when developing, implementing, or receiving AI applications in dentistry.Clinical Significance: While AI has become increasingly commonplace in dentistry, there are ethical concerns around its usage, and users (providers, patients, and other stakeholders), as well as the industry should consider these when developing, implementing, or receiving AI applications based on comprehensive framework to address the associated ethical challenges.

AB  - Background: The collection, storage, and analysis of large data sets are relevant in many sectors. Especially in the medical field, the processing of patient data promises great progress in personalized health care. However, it is strictly regulated, such as by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These regulations mandate strict data security and data protection and, thus, create major challenges for collecting and using large data sets. Technologies such as federated learning (FL), especially paired with differential privacy (DP) and secure multiparty computation (SMPC), aim to solve these challenges. Objective: This scoping review aimed to summarize the current discussion on the legal questions and concerns related to FL systems in medical research. We were particularly interested in whether and to what extent FL applications and training processes are compliant with the GDPR data protection law and whether the use of the aforementioned privacy-enhancing technologies (DP and SMPC) affects this legal compliance. We placed special emphasis on the consequences for medical research and development. Methods: We performed a scoping review according to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). We reviewed articles on Beck-Online, SSRN, ScienceDirect, arXiv, and Google Scholar published in German or English between 2016 and 2022. We examined 4 questions: whether local and global models are "personal data" as per the GDPR; what the "roles" as defined by the GDPR of various parties in FL are; who controls the data at various stages of the training process; and how, if at all, the use of privacy-enhancing technologies affects these findings. Results: We identified and summarized the findings of 56 relevant publications on FL. Local and likely also global models constitute personal data according to the GDPR. FL strengthens data protection but is still vulnerable to a number of attacks and the possibility of data leakage. These concerns can be successfully addressed through the privacy-enhancing technologies SMPC Conclusions: Combining FL with SMPC and DP is necessary to fulfill the legal data protection requirements (GDPR) in medical research dealing with personal data. Even though some technical and legal challenges remain, for example, the possibility of successful attacks on the system, combining FL with SMPC and DP creates enough security to satisfy the legal requirements of the GDPR. This combination thereby provides an attractive technical solution for health institutions willing to collaborate without exposing their data to risk. From a legal perspective, the combination provides enough built-in security measures to satisfy data protection requirements, and from a technical perspective, the combination provides secure systems with comparable performance with centralized machine learning applications.

AB  - Facility Management (FM) regards the management of buildings' assets and requires the administration of a large amount of data that must always be available, but today, they still consist of paper documents, which are susceptible to loss. This is one of the principal causes for costs increase in the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) phase, together with the lack of interoperability and communication. In recent years, the construction industry has been undergoing a process of digitalization, supported from the advent of new technologies that hit the market at low prices. This study aims to indagate the technologies introduced in in the FM sector, in addition the major authors and sources that are studying them. A bibliometric analysis is conducted on 220 documents belonging to the Scopus DB. The documents were analyzed using bibliometric analysis tools, such as Biblioshiny and VOSviewer. The results show how FM and the implementation of technologies in its practices, such as Building information modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT) and Digital Twin (DT), are fields with exponential growth in recent years. Other technologies, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and augmented reality (AR), emerged as part of digitalization in FM, which is part of the transition towards Construction 4.0.

AB  - Machine learning has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years, often referred to as an "artificial intelligence revolution." Biological systems inspire the fundamental approach for this new computing paradigm: using neural networks to classify large amounts of data into sorting categories. Current machine-learning schemes implement simulated neurons and synapses on standard computers based on a von Neumann architecture. This approach is inefficient in energy consumption, and thermal management, motivating the search for hardware-based systems that imitate the brain. Here, the present state of thermal management of neuromorphic computing technology and the challenges and opportunities of the energy-efficient implementation of neuromorphic devices are considered. The main features of brain-inspired computing and quantum materials for implementing neuromorphic devices are briefly described, the brain criticality and resistive switching-based neuromorphic devices are discussed, the energy and electrical considerations for spiking-based computation are presented, the fundamental features of the brain's thermal regulation are addressed, the physical mechanisms for thermal management and thermoelectric control of materials and neuromorphic devices are analyzed, and challenges and new avenues for implementing energy-efficient computing are described.

AB  - Permittivity at microwave frequencies determines the practical applications of microwave dielectric ceramics. The accuracy and universality of the permittivity prediction by Clausius-Mossotti equation depends on the dielectric polarizability (alpha(D)) database. The most influential alpha(D) database put forward by Shannon is facing three challenges in the 5 G era: (1) Few data, (2) Simplistic relation and (3) Low frequency (kHz-MHz) oriented. Here, we optimized and extended the Shannon's database for microwave frequencies by the four-stage multiple linear regression and support vector machine model. In comparison with the conventional database, the optimized and extended databases achieved higher accuracy and expanded the amount of data from 60 to more than 900. Besides, we analyzed the relationships between alpha(D) and ion characteristics, including ionic radius (IR), atomic number (N), valence state (V) and coordination number (CN). We found that the positive cubic law of "alpha(D) similar to IR3" discussed in Shannon's work was valid for the IR changed by the N, but invalid for the change caused by the CN.

AB  - BackgroundSilicosis has been one of the most serious occupational public health problems worldwide for many decades. The global burden of silicosis is largely unknown, although it is thought to be more prevalent in low and medium-income countries. Individual studies among workers exposed to silica dust in various industries, however, reveal a high prevalence of silicosis in India. This paper is an updated review of the novel challenges and opportunities for silicosis prevention and control in India.Main bodyThe unregulated informal sector employs workers on contractual appointment thereby insulating the employers from legislative provisions. Due to a lack of awareness of the serious health risks and low-income levels, symptomatic workers tend to disregard the symptoms and continue working in dusty environments. To prevent any future dust exposure, the workers must be moved to an alternative job in the same factory where they will not be exposed to silica dust. Government regulatory bodies, on the other hand, must guarantee that factory owners relocate workers to another vocation as soon as they exhibit signs of silicosis. Technological advances such as artificial intelligence and machine learning might assist industries in implementing effective and cost-saving dust control measures. A surveillance system needs to be established for the early detection and tracking of all patients with silicosis. A pneumoconiosis elimination program encompassing health promotion, personal protection, diagnostic criteria, preventive measures, symptomatic management, prevention of silica dust exposure, treatment, and rehabilitation is felt important for wider adoption.ConclusionSilica dust exposure and its consequences are fully preventable, with the benefits of prevention considerably outweighing the benefits of treating patients with silicosis. A comprehensive national health program on silicosis within the public health system would strengthen surveillance, notification, and management of workers exposed to silica dust in India.

AB  - In the context of a doomed end of the Moore's law, various new types of computing architectures have been emerging, aiming to meet the demands of intractable computation and artificial intelligence. Photonic computing is a competitive candidate, in light of the inherent properties of photons, including high propagation speed, strong robustness, and multiple degrees of freedom to encode information. Also, the progress of integrated photonics continues to provide novel possibilities, apart from boosting the scalability and stability of photonic computing architectures. Moreover, an introduction of quantum technology might open a new chapter for photonic computing, from the view of single photons. In this Perspective, we highlight the unique features and advances of integrated photonic platforms, whose roles in constructing a non-von Neumann computing architecture are also outlined. We show their potential in solving problems beyond the reach of traditional computers and in machine learning and further discuss the conceivable challenges and opportunities.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and its machine learning (ML) algorithms are offering new promise for personalized biomedicine and more cost-effective healthcare with impressive technical capability to mimic human cognitive capabilities. However, widespread application of this promising technology has been limited in the medical domain and expectations have been tampered by ethical challenges and concerns regarding patient privacy, legal responsibility, trustworthiness, and fairness. To balance technical innovation with ethical applications of AI/ML, developers must demonstrate the AI functions as intended and adopt strategies to minimize the risks for failure or bias. This review describes the new ethical challenges created by AI/ML for clinical care and identifies specific considerations for its practice in medicine. We provide an overview of regulatory and legal issues applicable in Europe and the United States, a description of technical aspects to consider, and present recommendations for trustworthy AI/ML that promote transparency, minimize risks of bias or error, and protect the patient well-being.
