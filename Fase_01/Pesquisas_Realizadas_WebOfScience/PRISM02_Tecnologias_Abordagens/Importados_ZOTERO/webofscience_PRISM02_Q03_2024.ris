AB  - The advent of large language models (LLMs) has energised research in Question-Answering (QA) tasks, enabling responses across varied domains like economics and mathematics. Despite their capabilities, LLMs often lack explainability due to their complex parameter embeddings. Additionally, integrating multimedia data into QA systems introduces challenges in processing and interpreting diverse data types such as text, images, audio, and video. This necessitates sophisticated algorithms for accurate information retrieval across media while ensuring the reliability of the data and responses remains a significant challenge. The AIQAM workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to address these challenges and enhance QA systems with multimedia data. The focus is on promoting innovations that improve the accuracy, explainability, and trustworthiness of QA systems, contributing to the development of the field.

AB  - Question-answering systems are recognized as popular and frequently effective means of information seeking on the web. In such systems, information seekers can receive a concise response to their queries by presenting their questions in natural language. Interactive question answering is a recently proposed and increasingly popular solution that resides at the intersection of question answering and dialogue systems. On the one hand, the user can ask questions in normal language and locate the actual response to her inquiry; on the other hand, the system can prolong the question-answering session into a dialogue if there are multiple probable replies, very few, or ambiguities in the initial request. By permitting the user to ask more questions, interactive question answering enables users to interact with the system and receive more precise results dynamically. This survey offers a detailed overview of the interactive question-answering methods that are prevalent in current literature. It begins by explaining the foundational principles of question-answering systems, hence defining new notations and taxonomies to combine all identified works inside a unified framework. The reviewed published work on interactive question-answering systems is then presented and examined in terms of its proposed methodology, evaluation approaches, and dataset/application domain. We also describe trends surrounding specific tasks and issues raised by the community, so shedding light on the future interests of scholars. Our work is further supported by a GitHub page synthesizing all the major topics covered in this literature study. https://sisinflab.github.io/interactive-question-answering-systems-survey/

AB  - With the continuous reform of education informatization, modern information technology gradually became a key technology in education. An intelligent question-answering system was constructed in this research for knowledge management services. It included an entity recognition model based on bidirectional long short-term memory attention conditional random field and a question classification model based on a bidirectional encoder using Transformers text convolutional neural network. The entity recognition model added a reverse long short-term memory propagation structure, while introducing an attention mechanism and conditional random field model. The question classification model utilized a preprocessed structure to output a feature matrix with richer semantic information, while utilizing a bidirectional encoder to extract local features of short text sentences. These experiments confirmed that the constructed model had a high precision of 0.945, which was much higher than other models. The recall of this proposed model was 0.077 higher than the control models. For precision, the proposed model had good recognition performance for methods, files and modules, with values of 0.9040, 0.9050 and 0.9160, respectively. For the recall, the question classification model had the best recognition effect on files, at 0.9060. For the F1-score, the proposed model had the best recognition performance for modules, at 0.9100. The named entity recognition model constructed had high accuracy and F1-score, reaching 0.931 and 0.923, indicating that it had the best classification performance in the dataset. Through intelligent question-answering systems, automatic answering of questions can be achieved, effectively improving knowledge services. This research has integrated knowledge and technology from multiple disciplines such as computer science, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing to promote the cross-integration of these disciplines in knowledge management. This interdisciplinary method not only broadens the research perspective of knowledge management but also provides new ideas and methods for the development of related fields.

AB  - Currently, an increasing number of governments have adopted question answering systems (QASs) in public service delivery. As some citizens with limited information literacy often express their questions vaguely when interacting with a chatbot, it is necessary to improve the contextual understanding and reasoning ability of government chatbots (G-chatbots). This goal can be achieved through the optimisation of the matching between question, answer and context. By incorporating the Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs) and fuzzy logic, this study proposes a multi-turn dialogue model that introduces a re-question mechanism and a subgraph matching algorithm. The experiment results show that the model can improve the contextual reasoning ability of G-chatbots by about 10% and generate answers in a more explainable way. This study innovatively integrates a question-answer-context matching approach, re-question mechanism into the MTRF-G-chatbot model, reducing barriers to citizens' access to government services and enhancing contextual reasoning abilities.

AB  - The multi-modal tasks have started to play a significant role in the research on artificial intelligence. A particular example of that domain is visual-linguistic tasks, such as visual question answering. The progress of modern machine learning systems is determined, among other things, by the data on which these systems are trained. Most modern visual question answering data sets contain limited type questions that can be answered either by directly accessing the image itself or by using external data. At the same time, insufficient attention is paid to the issues of social interactions between people, which limits the scope of visual question answering systems. In this paper, we propose criteria by which images suitable for social interaction visual question answering can be selected for composing such questions, based on psychological research. We believe this should serve the progress of visual question answering systems.

AB  - Introduction . The development of artificial intelligence methods and technologies aimed at speech recognition contributes to the creation of specialised programmes - namely voice assistants - which are capable of conducting a dialogue in natural language. Such services are of particular relevance in inclusive education in order to support students with visual impairments. The research problem lies in the individualised support of students' independent work based on a voice assistant and is determined by the contradiction between the widespread use of various question -answer systems in business and everyday life (including those with a voice interface), on the one hand, and insufficient knowledge their didactic possibilities, on the other hand. Aim. The present research aims to investigate and practically implement the methodology of inclu - sive design of digital educational resources on the example of creating an intelligent voice assistant for students' independent work in the course "Computer Networks". Methodology and research methods . The current research is based on the methodology of inclusive design in combination with an ontological approach in relation to the creation of digital educational resources, speech recognition methods, methods for designing intelligent systems and knowledge bases, methods and technologies for designing and implementing automated learning systems with feedback. To recognise questions, search for answers, and support dialogues carried out by a voice assistant, the authors applied natural language text analysis methods and classification models created using machine learning methods. Results. The authors have developed and substantiated the requirements that a digital educational resource must meet in accordance with the principles of inclusive design, linking an ontological approach to content development, automatic individualised support for students, and monitoring the achievement of educational results. According to the formulated requirements, the authors have developed an inter - active computer service - an intelligent voice assistant that provides support for students' independent work when performing practical tasks, using the "Computer Networks" course as an example. The service supports voice input and subsequent interpretation of questions, search for answers in the knowledge base with voice output of the result, and implements the execution of operations according to certain rules. Scientific novelty. The authors have clarified the content of the concept of "inclusive design" in the context of digital educational resources, when the key feature is the focus on continuous improvement of the didactic capabilities of a particular product. The authors have shown that this can be achieved through a conceptually based content structure and initially provided feedback. This approach has prov - en to be effective in designing an intelligent voice assistant to answer student questions and to automat - ically perform operations on a computer. Practical significance. The use of a voice assistant by students of the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Tyumen in the process of studying the course "Computer Net - works" demonstrated the relevance of developing similar question -answering systems to accompany the independent work of students, including those with visual impairments in online and blended learning. The developed service is universal and can be used with any knowledge base that provides answers to students' questions.

AB  - Objectives Question answering (QA) systems have the potential to improve the quality of clinical care by providing health professionals with the latest and most relevant evidence. However, QA systems have not been widely adopted. This systematic review aims to characterize current medical QA systems, assess their suitability for healthcare, and identify areas of improvement.Materials and methods We searched PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, ACL Anthology, and forward and backward citations on February 7, 2023. We included peer-reviewed journal and conference papers describing the design and evaluation of biomedical QA systems. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. We conducted a narrative synthesis and risk of bias assessment for each study. We assessed the utility of biomedical QA systems.Results We included 79 studies and identified themes, including question realism, answer reliability, answer utility, clinical specialism, systems, usability, and evaluation methods. Clinicians' questions used to train and evaluate QA systems were restricted to certain sources, types and complexity levels. No system communicated confidence levels in the answers or sources. Many studies suffered from high risks of bias and applicability concerns. Only 8 studies completely satisfied any criterion for clinical utility, and only 7 reported user evaluations. Most systems were built with limited input from clinicians.Discussion While machine learning methods have led to increased accuracy, most studies imperfectly reflected real-world healthcare information needs. Key research priorities include developing more realistic healthcare QA datasets and considering the reliability of answer sources, rather than merely focusing on accuracy.

AB  - The task of abstractive text summarization aims to automatically generate a short and concise summary of a given source article. In recent years, automatic abstractive text summarization has attracted the attention of researchers because large volumes of digital text are readily available in multiple languages on a wide range of topics. Automatically generating precise summaries from large text has potential application in the generation of news headlines, a summary of research articles, the moral of the stories, media marketing, search engine optimization, financial research, social media marketing, question-answering systems, and chatbots. In literature, the problem of abstractive text summarization has been mainly investigated for English and some other languages. However, it has not been thoroughly explored for the Urdu language despite having a huge amount of data available in digital format. To fulfill this gap, this paper presents a large benchmark corpus of 2,067,784 Urdu news articles for the Urdu abstractive text summarization task. As a secondary contribution, we applied a range of deep learning (LSTM, Bi-LSTM, LSTM with attention, GRU, Bi-GRU, and GRU with attention), and large language models (BART and GPT-3.5) on our proposed corpus. Our extensive evaluation on 20,000 test instances showed that GRU with attention model outperforms the other models with ROUGE- 1 = 46.7 , ROUGE- 2 = 24.1 , and ROUGE-L = 48.7. To foster research in Urdu, our proposed corpus is publically and freely available for research purposes under the Creative Common Licence.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare is revolutionizing medical information access and professional advice delivery. This study focuses on the development of a medical-specific question-answering model leveraging the Qwen-VL 7B model, an advanced Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM), to enhance the understanding and generation of medical texts. The Qwen-VL 7B model's capabilities in both language and visual comprehension make it an ideal candidate for medical question-answering systems, which require a deep grasp of medical knowledge and language. The research objectives include adapting the Qwen-VL 7B model to medical terminology, utilizing its visual understanding for medical imaging analysis, optimizing question-answering systems for medical scenarios, and evaluating the performance of these models. To achieve these goals, we employed methodologies such as dataset construction, model fine-tuning, and user studies.
