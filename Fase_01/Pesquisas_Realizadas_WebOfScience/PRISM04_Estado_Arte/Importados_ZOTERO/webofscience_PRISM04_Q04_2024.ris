AB  - Large language models (LLMs) exhibit expert-level performance in tasks across a wide range of different domains. Ethical issues raised by LLMs and the need to align future versions makes it important to know how state of the art models reason about moral and legal issues. In this paper, we employ the methods of experimental psychology to probe into this question. We replicate eight studies from the experimental literature with instances of Google's Gemini Pro, Anthropic's Claude 2.1, OpenAI's GPT-4, and Meta's Llama 2 Chat 70b. We find that alignment with human responses shifts from one experiment to another, and that models differ amongst themselves as to their overall alignment, with GPT-4 taking a clear lead over all other models we tested. Nonetheless, even when LLM-generated responses are highly correlated to human responses, there are still systematic differences, with a tendency for models to exaggerate effects that are present among humans, in part by reducing variance. This recommends caution with regards to proposals of replacing human participants with current state-of-the-art LLMs in psychological research and highlights the need for further research about the distinctive aspects of machine psychology.

AB  - This paper addresses the question of whether generative AI can create copyrightable works by making a comparative analysis between European Union law and U.S. copyright law. First, it is argued that for copyright law it does not seem possible for an entity other than a human being to be the copyright holder, thus ruling out the possibility of generative AI being considered a copyright holder. It is established that in US copyright the door it may be possible to register part of a work made using generative AI, and that in the EU this door remains open and pending evolution, although European jurisprudence already gives some guidelines. Afterwards, this paper explores possible infringement of exploitation rights in the different parts of the training process of generative AI models and in the activities that lead to the generation of content that is like intellectual works. It is concluded that in US law there is a gap in knowledge as to whether fair use would cover these types of activities. In European Law, although there are exceptions such as those in Directive 2001/29, it is not at all clear whether this will be sufficient to cover these activities, or whether the authorization of the rights owner will be necessary. If the latter is true and judging by the wave of lawsuits that have followed against companies and institutions that have made generative AI tools publicly available, it is possible that licensing negotiation may take a central role in the AI industry, with the negative consequences that this may bring for the advancement of science and for the public domain.

AB  - This paper responds to the question of whether judgements generated by judges using ChatGPT can be directly adopted. It posits that it is unjust for judges to rely on and directly adopt ChatGPT-generated judgements based on virtue jurisprudence theory. This paper innovatively applies case-based empirical analysis and is the first to use virtue jurisprudence approach to analyse the question and support its argument. The first section reveals the use of generative AI-based tools in judicial practice and the existence of erroneous judgements generated by ChatGPT through empirical research. The second section contends that generative AI, while mimicking virtuous behaviour, cannot produce justified beliefs according to virtue jurisprudence theory. Moreover, using AI as a decision-making entity could undermine the protection of human rights and interests. The paper concludes by suggesting normative and technical approaches for how judges should use generative AI-based tools to develop their virtues.

AB  - Companies are powerful initiators and adopters of AI, as they have been of previous industrial revolutions. Their boards of directors and the regulatory frameworks that govern directors will inevitably influence the development and implementation of AI. However, despite intense attention to AI regulation the regulatory contribution of directors' duties remains relatively unexamined. This article critically analyses the capacity of these longstanding legal principles to assist with wider AI regulatory goals, demonstrating that directors' duties have direct consequences for the regulation of AI. Evolved in response to the governance context of a complex artificial entity, the corporation, directors' duties map onto key AI regulatory requirements. These include the need for broadly accepted but flexible and responsive norms, and a capacity to engage post-facto with both nuanced, complex fact situations and opaque decision making processes. Directors' duties jurisprudence brings with it experience of reverse-engineering fact situations and responding to disembodied legal actors, two factors that may have wider AI regulatory application. Directors' duties also demonstrate responsiveness to changing social perspectives, facilitating integration of developing attitudes to AI. Attending to the AI regulatory role played by directors' duties can inform effective AI regulation and facilitate improved regulatory design overall.

TI  - (SYNTHETIC) STUMP SPEECH: CRAFTING GENERATIVE AI DISCLOSURE REGULATIONS FOR POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENTS
T2  - FORDHAM LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - DEMOCRACY
AB  - Synthetic media, or content generated using artificial intelligence, has begun to infect political advertising. Federal legislation has spent most of its time stalled in committees, but states and online platforms have rapidly implemented regulations. Although synthetic media may pose harms through voter manipulation and democratic distortion, it also can lower campaign costs and more vividly illustrate conceptions of a political choice's consequences. Some governments and commentators have sought to prohibit the most harmful forms, while others have focused more on transparent approaches to regulation. In the face of yet another contentious election cycle, the question of how to ensure choices are made based on belief and not manipulation looms large. This Note assesses the current regulatory landscape for synthetic media in political advertising to analyze the benefits and drawbacks of greater regulation. Based on current and emerging regulatory approaches, this Note examines how governments and private actors have limited synthetic media usage within existing First Amendment jurisprudence. Although initial prohibitions served a necessary role, this Note proposes that transparency enforcement is the best approach and should be built upon by creating a repository that contains information on an advertisement's synthetic content.

AB  - Background: This study correlates the up-to-date ethical, functional and legal evaluations related to the management and governance of artificial intelligence (AI) under European Union (EU) law, particularly impacting the health data sector and medical standards as provided by the Artificial Intelligence Act within the Regulation adopted by the European Council in May 2024. The initial proposal for the management and governance of the AI sector was submitted in April 2021. Three years later, on 13 March 2024, the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AIA) was adopted by the European Parliament. Subsequently, on 21 May 2024, the Council adopted an innovative legislative framework that harmonises the standards and rules for AI regulation. This framework is set to take effect in May 2026, with the central objective of stimulating and motivating a fair, safe, legal single market that respects the principles of ethics and the fundamental rights of the human person. Methods: The current legal analysis focuses on the European Unions' new institutional governance involving a multistage approach to managing health data, ethical artificial intelligence, generative artificial intelligence and classification of types of AI by considering the degree of risk (e.g. artificial intelligence systems with limited risk and systems with high risk) and medical devices. It outlines the legal framework for AI regulation and governance in the EU by focusing on compliance with the previously adopted legislation in the Medical Devices Regulation (2017) and the In-Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (2017). The paper also examines the application of the newly adopted EU Artificial Intelligence Act in relation to national justice systems, previous EU regulations on medical devices and personal data protection regulation, and its correlation with the European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence. This opens up complex discussions related to judicial reform and access to justice. For this purpose, as a research objective, the legal analysis includes an innovative perspective following an integrative discussion on the latest legal reforms and regulations of the AI sector in Eastern Europe launched in 2024 with a special focus on the latest developments in the EU Candidate Countries namely Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova. Results and conclusions: The present research facilitates the exploration of the real benefits of managing innovative AI systems for medical data, research, and development, as well as within the medical technology industry.

TI  - The First Amendment Meets the Virtual Public Square
T2  - DAEDALUS
LA  - English
AB  - Section 230, the twenty-six words that created the internet, has become the twenty-six words that are breaking the First Amendment. Section 230's blanket liability shield for social media platforms is harming our children and our democracy. In this essay, I narrate the story of what Section 230 enabled-the rise of the virtual public square, a circumstance that the framers could never have imagined-and explore its consequences for human well-being and freedom of expression. I conclude that Section 230 must be repealed to unleash First Amendment jurisprudence to confront the threats to the republic in the age of generative AI, as well as to usher in the next round of internet innovation in service of constitutional democratic sustainability. Bipartisan legislation has been introduced to sunset Section 230 as of December 31,2025. Those who believe in the enduring promise of American constitutional democracy should support its passage.

AB  - Background: Certain health-related risk factors require legal interventions. Medical-legal partnerships (MLPs) are collaborations between clinics and lawyers that address these health-harming legal needs (HHLNs) and have been shown to improve health and reduce utilization. Objective: The objective of this study is to explore the impact, barriers, and facilitators of MLP implementation in primary care clinics. Methods: A qualitative design using a semistructured interview assessed the perceived impact, barriers, and facilitators of an MLP, among clinicians, clinic and MLP staff, and clinic patients. Open AI software (otter.ai) was used to transcribe interviews, and NVivo was used to code the data. Braun & Clarke's framework was used to identify themes and subthemes. Results: Sixteen (n 1 / 4 16) participants were included in this study. Most respondents were women (81%) and white (56%). Four respondents were clinic staff, and 4 were MLP staff while 8 were clinic patients. Several primary themes emerged including: Patients experienced legal issues that were pernicious, pervasive, and complex; through trusting relationships, the MLP was able to improve health and resolve legal issues, for some; mistrust, communication gaps, and inconsistent staffing limited the impact of the MLP; and, the MLP identified coordination and communication strategies to enhance trust and amplify its impact. Conclusion: HHLNs can have a significant, negative impact on the physical and mental health of patients. Respondents perceived that MLPs improved health and resolved these needs, for some. Despite perceived successes, integration between the clinical and legal organizations was elusive. ( J Am Board Fam Med 2024;37:637-649.)

AB  - The aim of this work is to try to understand the impact of artificial intelligence in the legal reasoning. Despite the positive effects linked to the possibility of processing a large amount of data without a particular expenditure of time and energy, today's technicalscientific development raises many serious questions. In particular, the ongoing dialogue regarding the artificial intelligence (AI) should expand to consider the human rights implications of these technologies. The positive and negative impacts of AI on human rights are not distributed equally throughout society. One of the best ways to understand the impact of AI on human rights is by examining some interventions of the national jurisprudence, and not only, to addressing the challenges posed by AI.

The focus is on analysing North American jurisprudence on "fair use" from the obligatory balance between creative freedom and the protection of intellectual property (copyright), with special reference to the Warhol case; as well as the commitment of the Regulation on Artificial Intelligence of the European Union (2023 text) to demand, in these cases, transparent information on the data (and its owners) used for its training.
