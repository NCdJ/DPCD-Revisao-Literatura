AB  - Legal text retrieval serves as a key component in a wide range of legal text processing tasks such as legal question answering, legal case entailment, and statute law retrieval. The performance of legal text retrieval depends, to a large extent, on the representation of text, both query and legal documents. Based on good representations, a legal text retrieval model can effectively match the query to its relevant documents. Because legal documents often contain long articles and only some parts are relevant to queries, it is quite a challenge for existing models to represent such documents. In this paper, we study the use of attentive neural network-based text representation for statute law document retrieval. We propose a general approach using deep neural networks with attention mechanisms. Based on it, we develop two hierarchical architectures with sparse attention to represent long sentences and articles, and we name them Attentive CNN and Paraformer. The methods are evaluated on datasets of different sizes and characteristics in English, Japanese, and Vietnamese. Experimental results show that: (i) Attentive neural methods substantially outperform non-neural methods in terms of retrieval performance across datasets and languages; (ii) Pretrained transformer-based models achieve better accuracy on small datasets at the cost of high computational complexity while lighter weight Attentive CNN achieves better accuracy on large datasets; and (iii) Our proposed Paraformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods on COLIEE dataset, achieving the highest recall and F2 scores in the top-N retrieval task. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2022.

AB  - Applications of artificial intelligence to text processing and manipulation have recently increased, and promising results are being achieved. Because of this confidence in these results, it would be an attractive challenge to harness the potential of natural language processing and semantic for text comparison tasks. This article operates in this context, taking the field of law as a scope and outlining the preliminary stages of research activity, which examines the possibility of finding a method for comparing texts from legal sources in order to reveal possible contradictions. The study that this paper discusses focuses on the following activities: uniform semantic representation of information of concern extracted from a text using an ontological storytelling model; evaluation of natural language processing techniques to retrieve such information within written documents; and finally, a system of logical inference rules to carry out fact-based comparisons to highlight discrepancies or alignments. The application case examined is in the legal domain, more precisely, it aims at the comparison of testimonies that tell different versions of the same fact.  © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Legal judgment prediction (LJP) presents a formidable challenge in artificial intelligence, demanding intricate comprehension of legal texts, nuanced interpretation of statutes, and complex reasoning over multifaceted case elements. While recent advancements in natural language processing have shown promise, existing approaches often struggle to capture the sophisticated interplay between facts, legal principles, and precedents that characterize legal decision-making. This paper introduces LegalReasoner, a novel multi-stage framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and integrates domain-specific knowledge for enhanced legal judgment prediction. Our approach encompasses four key stages: 1) legal knowledge infusion, where we pre-train an LLM on a vast corpus of legal literature using contrastive learning techniques; 2) case-law retrieval, employing a graph neural network to identify relevant precedents and statutes; 3) multi-hop reasoning, utilizing a transformer-based architecture with a hierarchical attention mechanism to navigate complex legal arguments; and 4) judgment synthesis, where we employ a generative adversarial network to produce coherent and legally sound judgments. We evaluate LegalReasoner on two diverse datasets: the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) cases and the Chinese AI and Law Challenge (CAIL2018). Our framework demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average accuracy increase of 7.8% across all datasets. Furthermore, we conduct extensive ablation studies and interpretability analyses to elucidate the contributions of each component and provide insights into the model's decision-making process. Our work not only advances the field of automated legal reasoning but also offers a transparent and explainable system that could serve as a valuable tool for legal professionals. By bridging the gap between AI and legal expertise, LegalReasoner paves the way for more efficient, consistent, and fair legal decision-making processes. ©2024 The Authors.

AB  - This paper describes the creation and implementation of the "Legal X-Ray," an innovative application designed to enhance the drafting process of petitions and official documents within the Attorney General's Office of the State of Rio de Janeiro (PGE-RJ). The application was developed to integrate with PGE Digital, a lawsuit management system, aiming to automate the analysis of initial pleadings and document generation in the context of mass litigation. Employing Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Regular Expression (REGEX) techniques through the SpaCy library, the Legal X-Ray is capable of extracting relevant information from legal documents and converting them into categorized hashtags. These hashtags are then utilized to facilitate and expedite the creation of legal documents, contributing to a significant increase in operational efficiency and reduction in the PGE-RJ's response time. The application has proven to be a valuable tool in processing large volumes of data, allowing legal professionals to focus their efforts on tasks of greater analytical complexity. This case study examines the development and deployment of the Legal X-Ray, discussing its challenges, methods, and the positive outcomes achieved in daily legal practice. © 2024 Digital Transformation and Innovation Management.

AB  - This paper contributes to ongoing scholarly debates on the merits and limitations of computational legal text analysis by reflecting on the results of a research project documenting exceptional COVID-19 management measures in Europe. The variety of exceptional measures adopted in countries characterized by different legal systems and natural languages, as well as the rapid evolution of such measures, pose considerable challenges to manual textual analysis methods traditionally used in the social sciences. To address these challenges, we develop a supervised classifier to support the manual coding of exceptional policies by a multinational team of human coders. After presenting the results of various natural language processing (NLP) experiments, we show that human-in-the-loop approaches to computational text analysis outperform unsupervised approaches in accurately extracting policy events from legal texts. We draw lessons from our experience to ensure the successful integration of NLP methods into social science research agendas. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Named entity recognition (NER) is a crucial task in natural language processing, particularly challenging in the legal domain due to the intricate and lengthy nature of legal entities. Existing methods often struggle with accurately identifying entity boundaries and types in legal texts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence framework designed specifically for the legal domain. This framework features an entity-type-aware module that leverages contrastive learning to enhance the prediction of entity types. Additionally, we incorporate a decoder with a copy mechanism that accurately identifies complex legal entities without the need for explicit tagging schemas. Our extensive experiments on two legal datasets show that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving notable improvements in precision, recall, and F1 score. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in improving entity recognition in legal texts, offering a promising direction for future research in legal NER. © Copyright 2024 Mao et al.

AB  - Legal professionals face the growing challenge of managing large amounts of complex legal documents. This paper introduces a new solution that combines machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to change the way legal documents are summarized and analyzed. Our approach leverages the ability of ML algorithms to extract important information from a variety of legal documents including contracts, court decisions, laws, and legal opinions and then uses NLP algorithms to transform that data this has been filtered into a clear and concise summary that captures the main content of original documents. This summary is not only highly accurate but also scalable to a wide range of legal documents, saving legal professionals time and resources. The authors experimented with domain-independent model for legal text summarization, called BART. Summarized documents are evaluated by registered experts against various criteria and using the ROUGE metric this shows that the text summarization is effective in legal texts with independent domain-model. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2024.

AB  - Summarizing legal case judgments is a complex task in Legal Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a gap in understanding how various summarization models, including extractive and abstractive approaches and analysing the perform within the domain of legal documents. Since there are around 4 crore pending cases in the Indian court system, this study addresses the challenge of laborious task of manually summarizing legal documents. It introduces both supervised and unsupervised models for both extractive and abstractive summarization, showcasing their effective performance through evaluations using ROUGE metrics and BERT score. BART, T5, PEGASUS, ROBERTA, Legal-PEGASUS, Legal-BERT models are used for abstractive summarisation. TextRank, LexRank, LSA, Summarizer BERT, KL-Summ are used in case of extractive summarisation. Longformer, Bert - Legal Pegasus are also considered for the task of Summarisation. In the domain of legal document summarization, we used GPT-4 and LLAMA-2, employing prompt engineering with both Zero-shot and Oneshot prompts to extract summaries. As far of our knowledge, this is the first paper that used Large Language Models like GPT-4 and LLama-2 for the task of Legal Text summarisation. Along with that a user-friendly chatbot has been developed utilizing the Llama model and specifically designed to respond for queries related to legal texts. Additionally, a web application has been created, allowing users to upload legal documents for summarization. An option is given to users to select from various languages including Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, and Hindi. As a result the summarised text is converted into respective language.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Automated summarization of legal texts poses a significant challenge due to the complex and specialized nature of legal documentation. Despite the recent progress in reinforcement learning for natural language text summarization, its application in the legal domain has been less effective. This paper introduces SAC-VAE, a novel reinforcement learning framework specifically designed for legal text summarization. We leverage a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to condense the high-dimensional state space into a more manageable lowerdimensional feature space. These compressed features are subsequently utilized by the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm for policy learning, facilitating the automated generation of summaries from legal texts. Through comprehensive experimentation, we have empirically demonstrated the effectiveness and superior performance of the SAC-VAE framework in legal text summarization.  © 2024 Wang, Wu.
