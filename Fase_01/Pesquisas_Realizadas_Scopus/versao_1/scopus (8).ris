AB  - Question answering system aims at retrieving precise information from a large collection of documents. This work presents a question answering method to apply on Hadith in order to provide an informative answer corresponding to the user's query. Hadith englobes stories and qualification of the prophet Muhammad (PBSL). It also includes the sayings of his companions and their disciples. The problem with current methods is that they fail to capture the meaning when comparing a sentence and a user's query; hence there is often a conflict between the extracted sentences and user's requirements. However, our proposed method has successfully tackled this problem through: (1) avoiding extract a passage whose similarity with the query is high but whose meaning is different. (2) Computing the semantic and syntactic similarity of the sentence-to-sentence and sentence-to-query. (3) Expanding the words in both the query and sentences to tackle the fundamental problem of term mismatch between sentences and the user's query. Furthermore, in order to reduce redundant Hadith texts, the proposed method uses the greedy algorithm to impose diversity penalty on the sentences. The experimental results display that the proposed method is able to improve performance compared with the existing methods on Hadith datasets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Building a computer system, which can automatically answer questions in the human language, speech or text, is a long-standing goal of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field. Question analysis, the task of extracting important information from the input question, is the first and crucial step towards a question answering system. In this paper, we focus on the task of Vietnamese question analysis in the education domain. Our goal is to extract important information expressed by named entities in an input question, such as university names, campus names, major names, and teacher names. We present several extraction models that utilize the advantages of both traditional statistical methods with handcrafted features and more recent advanced deep neural networks with automatically learned features. Our best model achieves 88.11% in the F1 score on a corpus consisting of 3,600 Vietnamese questions collected from the fan page of the International School, Vietnam National University, Hanoi. © 2020 Ngo Xuan Bach et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - While RDF was designed to make data easily readable by machines, it does not make data easily usable by end-users. Question Answering (QA) over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is seen as the technology which is able to bridge this gap. It aims to build systems which are capable of extracting the answer to a user’s natural language question from an RDF dataset. In recent years, many approaches were proposed which tackle the problem of QA over KGs. Despite such efforts, it is hard and cumbersome to create a Question Answering system on top of a new RDF dataset. The main open challenge remains portability, i.e., the possibility to apply a QA algorithm easily on new and previously untested RDF datasets. In this publication, we address the problem of portability by presenting an architecture for a portable QA system. We present a novel approach called QAnswer KG, which allows the construction of on-demand QA systems over new RDF datasets. Hence, our approach addresses non-expert users in QA domain. In this paper, we provide the details of QA system generation process. We show that it is possible to build a QA system over any RDF dataset while requiring minimal investments in terms of training. We run experiments using 3 different datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to design a process for non-expert users. We enable such users to efficiently create an on-demand, scalable, multilingual, QA system on top of any RDF dataset. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - The ARQMath Lab at CLEF 2020 considers the problem of finding answers to new mathematical questions among posted answers on a community question answering site (Math Stack Exchange). Queries are question postings held out from the test collection, each containing both text and at least one formula. We expect this to be a challenging task, as both math and text may be needed to find relevant answer posts. While several models have been proposed for text question answering, math question answering is in an earlier stage of development. To advance math-aware search and mathematical question answering systems, we will create a standard test collection for researchers to use for benchmarking. ARQMath will also include a formula retrieval sub-task: individual formulas from question posts are used to locate formulas in earlier answer posts, with relevance determined by narrative fields created based on the original question. We will use these narrative fields to explore diverse information needs for formula search (e.g., alternative notation, applications in specific fields or definition). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Question answering (QA) in the legal domain has gained increasing popularity for people to seek legal advice. However, existing QA systems struggle to comprehend the legal context and provide jurisdictionally relevant answers due to the lack of domain expertise. In this paper, we develop an Artificial Intelligence Law Assistant (AILA) for question answering in the domain of Chinese laws. AILA system automatically comprehends users' natural language queries with the help of the legal knowledge graph (KG) and provides the best-matching answers for given queries. In addition, AILA provides visual cues to interpret the input queries and candidate answers based on the legal KG. Experimental results on a large-scale legal QA corpus show the effectiveness of AILA. To the best of our knowledge, AILA is the first Chinese legal QA system which integrates the domain knowledge from legal KG to comprehend the questions and answers for ranking QA pairs. AILA is available at http://bmilab.ticp.io:48478/. © 2020 Inst. Sci. inf., Univ. Defence in Belgrade. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article describes Daphne, a virtual assistant for designing Earth observation distributed spacecraft missions. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the first virtual assistant for such application. The article provides a thorough description of Daphne, including its question answering system and the main features we have implemented to help system engineers design distributed spacecraft missions. In addition, the article describes a study performed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to assess the usefulness of Daphne in this use case. The study was conducted with N = 9 subjects from JPL, who were asked to work on a mission design task with two versions of Daphne, one that was fully featured implementing the cognitive assistance functions, and one that only had the features one would find in a traditional design space exploration tool. After the task, they filled out a standard user experience survey, completed a test to assess how much they learned about the task, and were asked a number of questions in a semi-structured exit interview. Results of the study suggest that Daphne can help improve performance during system design tasks compared to traditional tools, while keeping the system usable. However, the study also raises some concerns with respect to a potential reduction in human learning due to the use of the cognitive assistant. The article ends with a list of suggestions for future development of virtual assistants for space mission design. © 2008-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the key techniques in intelligent question-answering (Q&A) systems. Although recurrent neural networks and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks exhibit obvious advantages on well-known English Q&A datasets, they still suffer from several defects including indeterminateness, polysemy and the lack of changing morphology in Chinese, which results in complex NLP on large and diverse Chinese Q&A datasets. In this paper, we first analyze limitations of applying LSTM and bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models to noisy Chinese Q&A datasets. Then, we focus on integrating attention mechanisms and multi-granularity word segmentation into Bi-LSTM and propose an attention mechanism and multi-granularity-based Bi-LSTM model (AM–Bi-LSTM) which combines the improved attention mechanism with a novel processing of multi-granularity word segmentation to handle the complex NLP in Chinese Q&A datasets. Furthermore, similarity of questions and answers is formulated to implement the quantitative computation which helps to achieve better performance in Chinese Q&A systems. Finally, we verify the proposed model on a noisy Chinese Q&A dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the novel AM–Bi-LSTM model achieves significant improvement on evaluation metrics of accuracy, mean average precision and so on. Moreover, the experimental results indicate that the novel AM–Bi-LSTM model outperforms baseline methods and other LSTM-based models. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The field of text mining which deals with the providing of answers to the questions of the users is also one of the hot topics for researchers. The difficulty seen in the proper answering of the questions needs to be resolved. The large variety of questions fails in the QA system. In this paper, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been used which deals with the processing of the data that comes in any form like text, video, image, or audio. This NLP comes under the field of artificial intelligence (AI), which is used in the field of question answering (QA) system. Here proposed work for designing a system that works for factoid QA which will answer the questions that are asked by the users. Lexical Chain and Keyword analysis are used in our system for the answering of questions from a given set of articles. The reasoning system is used for the validity of the answering. The experiment here is done with the SQUAD dataset. In our experiment, the accuracy obtained for the passage retrieval using TFIDF is 69.69%. The overall average of the correct prediction of the answer is 69.93%. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Deep pre-training and fine-tuning models (such as BERT and OpenAI GPT) have demonstrated excellent results in question answering areas. However, due to the sheer amount of model parameters, the inference speed of these models is very slow. How to apply these complex models to real business scenarios becomes a challenging but practical problem. Previous model compression methods usually suffer from information loss during the model compression procedure, leading to inferior models compared with the original one. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Two-stage Multi-teacher Knowledge Distillation (TMKD for short) method for web Question Answering system. We first develop a general Q&A distillation task for student model pre-training, and further fine-tune this pre-trained student model with multi-teacher knowledge distillation on downstream tasks (like Web Q&A task, MNLI, SNLI, RTE tasks from GLUE), which effectively reduces the overfitting bias in individual teacher models, and transfers more general knowledge to the student model. The experiment results show that our method can significantly outperform the baseline methods and even achieve comparable results with the original teacher models, along with substantial speedup of model inference. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.
