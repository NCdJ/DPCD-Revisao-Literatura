AB  - The penetration of AI (artificial intelligence) in our daily lives is becoming increasingly apparent. Its presence is subtly but unstoppably gaining ground. Our justice system cannot remain unaware of this reality. While there are weak versions of AI that pose hardly any legal or ethical problems by simply making our lives easier, strong AI, capable of making decisions on its own, causes suspicion and animosity in equal proportion. Two fundamental questions stem from this perspective. First, whether it is possible that in a nearby future a robot judge will be able to decide on our wealth and/or freedom. Second if it is convenient and safe for it to do so. This article aims to answer both questions. To do so, we use the traditional methodology in law, consisting in consulting a significant number of bibliographical sources and applicable regulations (still work in progress) to formulate our particular approach to the subject. No jurisprudence was consulted for obvious reasons. The article closes with a reflection looking to the future, containing conclusions and lege ferenda’s recommendations for a future regulation of AI in our legal system. © 2023 Prensas Universitarias de Zaragoza.

AB  - ChatGPT is a sophisticated large-language model able to answer high-level questions in a way that is does not trigger conventional plagiarism detectors. Concerns have been raised that and similar forms of ‘generative AI’ pose a significant threat to academic integrity in higher education. To evaluate this risk in the context of legal education specifically, this project had ChatGPT (using the GPT3.5 model available in January 2023) generate answers to twenty-four different exams from an English-language law school based in a common law jurisdiction. It found that the system performed best on exams that were essay-based and asked students to discuss international legal instruments or general legal principles not necessarily specific to any jurisdiction. It performed worst on exams that featured problem-style or “issue spotting” questions asking students to apply an invented factual scenario to local legislation or jurisprudence. While the project suggests that for the most part conventional law school assessments are for the time being relatively immune from the threat generative AI brings, the project provides only a baseline snapshot of how large-language models tackle assessment in higher education. As both the technology improves and students learn how to harness it, increasingly fewer forms of assessment will be beyond its reach. However, rather than attempt to block students from using AI as part of learning and assessment, this paper instead proposes three ways students may be taught to use it in appropriate and ethical ways. While it is clear that generative AI will change how universities teach and assess (across disciplines), a solution of prevention or denial is no solution at all. © 2023, Australasian Law Academics Association.

AB  - Jurisprudence involves studying, interpreting, and applying the law to comprehend its societal impact. Judges annually review cases to ensure accurate law application, which raises privacy concerns when accessing files from other courts. While the legal field has garnered interest from the research community, the challenge of masking personal data, particularly in the Arabic language with limited resources, remains in its early stages. To address this research gap, we develop a two-component system for generating anonymous Arabic judgments. The first component, a personal data extractor model, utilizes Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify key individual entities like names, addresses, birthdays, case numbers, and national identity codes. We train this model on a purpose-built Arabic legal corpus. The second component involves a Python module designed to mask the personal entities extracted by the first component. Together, these components enable the generation of anonymous judgments. Our model achieves an F1-score of 96.14% when detecting entities in the created Arabic Legal corpus. Additionally, experiments on the ANERCorp corpus, with training and testing splits of 70%-30% and 90%-10%, yield F1-scores of 93.78% and 95.77%, respectively. With these results, our proposed system demonstrates the promising potential for generating anonymous Arabic judgments. Furthermore, the built Arabic legal corpus provides a valuable resource for researchers aiming to enhance domain-specific NER models in Arabic text.  © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - In recent years, the use of AI systems by Public Administrations, both in the context of administrative activities in general and, more specifically, in the context of decision-making processes, has increased disproportionately. However, given the difficulty of tracking down a specific law regarding the use of such systems in a public context in European and national law, especially in the context of administrative decision-making processes affecting the legal sphere of individual citizens, both administrative jurisprudence and the Italian Data Protection Authority have attempted to provide Public Administrations with guidance in this regard. On the one hand, they identify the legal requirements with which such systems must comply in order to be used, and, on the other, indicate (the Italian Data Protection Authority in particular) the main guarantees to be put in place in the case of their use or implementation. Among the legal requirements, one emerges in particular: that of the “non-exclusivity of the algorithmic decision”, from which the obligation to guarantee human intervention in the context of automated decision-making processes that may have significant effects on the legal sphere of citizens stems. This obligation derives from administrative jurisprudence from Article 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). However, jurisprudence makes no reference to the exceptions provided for in the same provision. When read in conjunction with Italian data protection regulations that have recently undergone important changes with Decree Law of October 8, 2021, no. 139, converted by Law No. 205 of December 3, 2021, this provision could allow administrations to introduce AI systems as part of their decision-making processes also without the need to ensure any human intervention, which could give rise to the risk of undermining the principle of legality that oversees administrative action. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - With general computing technology being easily accessible to any individual, concerns arise when academic testing is implemented. These concerns include the potential effect on academic integrity, veracity and tenability, through the act of cheating. Mobile phones are as common as textbooks in the classroom. Microcomputers the size of a fingernail, with the ability to compute, display, and output information to a user are no longer an assumptive prognostication of an outdated science fiction reader. COVID-19 brought with it a shift to remote, online learning, both in high schools and colleges, where acts of academic dishonesty abounded. There is a dire need to address the issue of cheating in academia, especially those facets of academia conducted remotely. Students who cheat may be unprepared for college-level coursework or lack true disciplinary skills needed to enter the workforce. The result is that colleges and universities may need to increase spending to better monitor testing, as well as enhance remedial services to students who enter college unprepared. Increased cost remedies may be passed on to future students through increased tuition costs. This paper provides a review of the topic of technology and its role in academic cheating, in addition to concise conclusions for the educator. Special attention is gi ven to the current and future possibility of microelectronic technology being used in deceitful academic acts. In addition, based on the results of the literature survey conducted for this work, recommendations for future research in this area are discussed at length. Educators face a seeming dichotomy: persist in traditional anti-cheating educational structures, advancing anti-cheating technology and jurisprudence; or, embrace technological progress and encourage the cooperative use of student technology in learning. Finally, we propose incorporating Agile approaches in education as a potential solution. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.

AB  - According to the Constitution, the right of every person to education is guaranteed in the Russian Federation. The relevance of research. The authors of the article note that modern education in Russia and internationally is undergoing significant changes due to the active introduction of artificial intelligence into human life. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a way to make a computer - controlled robot or program capable of thinking as intelligently as a person. The basis for the creation of artificial intelligence are the following sciences and technologies: computer science, biology, psychology, linguistics.. The novelty of the research lies in determining the main directions of transformation of the educational process at the university in the conditions of cybersocialization of society. The purpose of the study is to identify the possibilities and problems of using artificial intelligence in the educational process and jurisprudence. The main tasks that need to be solved in this work: 1. To understand the reasons for the creation of artificial intelligence and the possibilities of its application in education and law at the present stage of development of society; 2. To explore possible areas of application of artificial intelligence technologies in the educational process; 3. To reveal the prospects of using artificial intelligence in teaching students and schoolchildren; 4. Evaluate the pros and cons of using artificial intelligence in education and law. The object of research in this article is artificial intelligence technologies. The subject of the research is the ways of improving and developing artificial intelligence in its application in education and law. The degree of scientific development of the topic of the publication. In the studies of A. A. Verbitsky, N. S. Ilyushenko, N. B. Strekalova, N. S. Kramarenko, A. Yu. Kvashina, S. D. Karakozova, A. Yu.Uvarova and A. Y.Akimova, on which this article is based, talk about the properties of digital education and the use of artificial intelligence technologies in it, about its possible advantages. Among them: accessibility, increasing the level of interactivity of training, the ability to choose the time, maximum audience coverage. The practical significance of the research lies in the possibility of applying its results in educational institutions of secondary education, secondary vocational education and higher education. Conclusions of the study: 1. Intellectual is a system that allows you to enhance a person's mental activity by conducting a meaningful dialogue with him. 2. It is obvious that it is impossible and unnecessary to create a universal artificial intelligence. Highly specialized intellectual systems should be created, for example in education and law, which will not replace a person, but will facilitate his work. A person is not able to read a novel in one minute. The computer can do it. 3. The joint activity of man and machine, which analyzes information and presents it for selection, becomes relevant. 4. Today, artificial intelligence is a self-learning tool that enhances human activity in generating and making decisions. 5. In the current period, it will be necessary to resolve the issue of correlating the experience of introducing artificial intelligence into the most important social institutions of society, including education, and the existing proven practices of the traditional form of education.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years, the genetic testing and selection of IVF embryos, known as preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), has gained much traction in clinical assisted reproduction for preventing transmission of genetic defects. However, a more recent ethically and morally controversial development in PGT is its possible use in selecting IVF embryos for optimal intelligence quotient (IQ) and other non–disease-related socially desirable traits, such as tallness, fair complexion, athletic ability, and eye and hair colour, based on polygenic risk scores (PRS), in what is referred to as PGT-P. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning–based analysis of big data sets collated from genome sequencing of specific human ethnic populations can be used to estimate an individual embryo’s likelihood of developing such multifactorial traits by analysing the combination of specific genetic variants within its genome. Superficially, this technique appears compliant with Islamic principles and ethics. Because there is no modification of the human genome, there is no tampering with Allah’s creation (taghyīr khalq Allah). Nevertheless, a more critical analysis based on the five maxims of Islamic jurisprudence (qawa'id fiqhiyyah) that are often utilized in discourses on Islamic bioethics, namely qaṣd (intention), yaqın̄ (certainty), ḍarar (injury), ḍarūra (necessity), and `urf (custom), would instead reveal some major ethical and moral flaws of this new medical technology in the selection of non–disease-related socially desirable traits, and its non-compliance with the spirit and essence of Islamic law (shariah). Muslim scholars, jurists, doctors, and biomedical scientists should debate this further and issue a fatwa on this new medical technology platform. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - This paper explores artificial intelligence (AI) ethics from an Islamic perspective at a critical time for AI ethical norm-setting. It advocates for a pluralist approach to ethical AI benchmarking. As rapid advancements in AI technologies pose challenges surrounding autonomy, privacy, fairness, and transparency, the prevailing ethical discourse has been predominantly Western or Eurocentric. To address this imbalance, this paper delves into the Islamic ethical traditions to develop a framework that contributes to the global debate on optimal norm setting for designing and using AI technologies. The paper outlines Islamic parameters for ethical values and moral actions in the context of AI's ethical uncertainties. It emphasizes the significance of both textual and non-textual Islamic sources in addressing these uncertainties while placing a strong emphasis on the notion of "good" or "maṣlaḥa" as a normative guide for AI's ethical evaluation. Defining maṣlaḥa as an ethical state of affairs in harmony with divine will, the paper highlights the coexistence of two interpretations of maṣlaḥa: welfarist/utility-based and duty-based. Islamic jurisprudence allows for arguments supporting ethical choices that prioritize building the technical infrastructure for AI to maximize utility. Conversely, it also supports choices that reject consequential utility calculations as the sole measure of value in determining ethical responses to AI advancements. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The infusion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into every facet of life has raised pertinent questions about its potential integration within the legal system, a domain traditionally governed by human judgment, principles of equity, and the pursuit of sound jurisprudence. The Supreme Court of India has historically been a bastion of 'demosprudence,' emphasizing a humanistic approach to the administration of justice. Nevertheless, the rapid advancement of scientific methods and technologies necessitates the consideration of AI's application in the legal system. In contemporary times, AI is being utilized by courts in various capacities, such as data storage and retrieval, multi-body litigation service systems, online dispute resolution platforms, and even judgment prediction. However, the authenticity and integrity of AI-driven solutions remain a subject of skepticism among academics and experts, primarily due to the inherent limitations of AI's application in this context. This paper delves into a comprehensive exploration of AI applications within the Indian Judicial System, meticulously analyzing its potential benefits and limitations. From AI-driven case management to the digitalization of dispute resolution platforms, the impact of AI on the judiciary is scrutinized. The study emphasizes the imperative need for responsible AI adoption, advocating for measures that can facilitate its effective integration while addressing the associated concerns and ensuring a harmonious coexistence of AI and human judgment in the legal realm.  © 2023 IEEE.
