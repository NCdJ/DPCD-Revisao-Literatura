AB  - The integration of AI-empowered tools in medicine and healthcare raises crucial questions about medical accountability from an Islamic perspective. The chapter addresses two main questions: (a) what is the ethical framework that governs medical accountability, and (b) to what extent would AI-empowered medicine impact this ethical framework? To address the first question, the chapter explores the views of classical and contemporary Muslim jurists on the concept of medical accountability by examining the roles played by the three main stakeholders prominently featured in their discussions: God, the patient and the physician. To address the second question, the analysis of the discussions relevant to each stakeholder is followed by a distinct section dedicated to explaining how these discussions relate to the context of AI-empowered medicine. As demonstrated in this chapter, certain elements of the Islamic ethical framework of medical accountability are likely to remain unchanged; for example, the requirement that AI-enabled medical interventions should be permitted by God, consented to by the patient and performed by a competent physician. However, new elements need to be incorporated into this ethical framework. Besides the individual liability usually borne by the treating physician, new forms of liability should be considered, such as collective liability jointly borne by a medical team, corporate liability by a licensing institution and the liability that AI developers can bear. © The Editors and Contributing Authors Severally 2024.

AB  - Legal scholars have long annotated cases by hand to summarize and learn about developments in jurisprudence. Dramatic recent improvements in the performance of large language models (LLMs) now provide a potential alternative. This article demonstrates how to use LLMs to analyze legal documents. It evaluates best practices and suggests both the uses and potential limitations of LLMs in empirical legal research. In a simple classification task involving Supreme Court opinions, it finds that GPT-4 performs approximately as well as human coders and significantly better than a variety of prior-generation natural language processing (NLP) classifiers, with no improvement from supervised training, finetuning, or specialized prompting. © 2024 Mohr Siebeck.

AB  - This paper addresses the question of whether generative AI can create copyrightable works by making a comparative analysis between European Union law and U.S. copyright law. First, it is argued that for copyright law it does not seem possible for an entity other than a human being to be the copyright holder, thus ruling out the possibility of generative AI being considered a copyright holder. It is established that in US copyright the door it may be possible to register part of a work made using generative AI, and that in the EU this door remains open and pending evolution, although European jurisprudence already gives some guidelines. Afterwards, this paper explores possible infringement of exploitation rights in the different parts of the training process of generative AI models and in the activities that lead to the generation of content that is like intellectual works. It is concluded that in US law there is a gap in knowledge as to whether fair use would cover these types of activities. In European Law, although there are exceptions such as those in Directive 2001/29, it is not at all clear whether this will be sufficient to cover these activities, or whether the authorization of the rights owner will be necessary. If the latter is true and judging by the wave of lawsuits that have followed against companies and institutions that have made generative AI tools publicly available, it is possible that licensing negotiation may take a central role in the AI industry, with the negative consequences that this may bring for the advancement of science and for the public domain. © 2024, Asociacion Espanola de Inteligencia Artificial.

AB  - Background: Certain health-related risk factors require legal interventions. Medical-legal partnerships (MLPs) are collaborations between clinics and lawyers that address these health-harming legal needs (HHLNs) and have been shown to improve health and reduce utilization. Objective: The objective of this study is to explore the impact, barriers, and facilitators of MLP implementation in primary care clinics. Methods: A qualitative design using a semistructured interview assessed the perceived impact, barriers, and facilitators of an MLP, among clinicians, clinic and MLP staff, and clinic patients. Open AI software (otter.ai) was used to transcribe interviews, and NVivo was used to code the data. Braun & Clarke’s framework was used to identify themes and subthemes. Results: Sixteen (n ¼ 16) participants were included in this study. Most respondents were women (81%) and white (56%). Four respondents were clinic staff, and 4 were MLP staff while 8 were clinic patients. Several primary themes emerged including: Patients experienced legal issues that were pernicious, pervasive, and complex; through trusting relationships, the MLP was able to improve health and resolve legal issues, for some; mistrust, communication gaps, and inconsistent staffing limited the impact of the MLP; and, the MLP identified coordination and communication strategies to enhance trust and amplify its impact. Conclusion: HHLNs can have a significant, negative impact on the physical and mental health of patients. Respondents perceived that MLPs improved health and resolved these needs, for some. Despite perceived successes, integration between the clinical and legal organizations was elusive. © 2024 American Board of Family Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) exhibit expert-level performance in tasks across a wide range of different domains. Ethical issues raised by LLMs and the need to align future versions makes it important to know how state of the art models reason about moral and legal issues. In this paper, we employ the methods of experimental psychology to probe into this question. We replicate eight studies from the experimental literature with instances of Google's Gemini Pro, Anthropic's Claude 2.1, OpenAI's GPT-4, and Meta's Llama 2 Chat 70b. We find that alignment with human responses shifts from one experiment to another, and that models differ amongst themselves as to their overall alignment, with GPT-4 taking a clear lead over all other models we tested. Nonetheless, even when LLM-generated responses are highly correlated to human responses, there are still systematic differences, with a tendency for models to exaggerate effects that are present among humans, in part by reducing variance. This recommends caution with regards to proposals of replacing human participants with current state-of-the-art LLMs in psychological research and highlights the need for further research about the distinctive aspects of machine psychology. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is not only increasingly being used in business and administration contexts, but a race for its regulation is also underway, with the European Union (EU) spearheading the efforts. Contrary to existing literature, this article suggests that the most far-reaching and effective EU rules for AI applications in the digital economy will not be contained in the proposed AI Act, but in the Digital Markets Act (DMA). We analyse the impact of the DMA and related EU acts on AI models and underlying data across four key areas: disclosure requirements; the regulation of AI training data; access rules; and the regime for fair rankings. We demonstrate that fairness, under the DMA, goes beyond traditionally protected categories of non-discrimination law on which scholarship at the intersection of AI and law has focused on. Rather, we draw on competition law and the FRAND criteria known from intellectual property law to interpret and refine the DMA provisions on fair rankings. Moreover, we show how, based on Court of Justice of the European Union jurisprudence, a coherent interpretation of the concept of non-discrimination in both traditional non-discrimination and competition law may be found. The final section sketches out proposals for a comprehensive framework of transparency, access and fairness under the DMA and beyond. © The Author(s), 2023.

AB  - The rapid integration of generative AI technology across various domains has brought forth a complex interplay between technological advancements, legal frameworks, and ethical considerations. In a world where generative AI has transcended its initial novelty and is now woven into the fabric of everyday life, the boundaries of human creativity and machine-generated output are becoming increasingly blurred. The paper scrutinizes existing privacy laws and regulations through the lens of generative AI, seeking to uncover gaps, challenges, and possible avenues for reform. It explores the evolution of jurisprudence in the face of technological disruption and debates the adequacy of current legal frameworks to address the dynamic complexities of AI-influenced privacy infringements. By scrutinizing cases where personal data has been exploited by nefarious actors employing generative AI for malevolent purposes, a stark reality emerges: the emergence of a new avenue for privacy breaches that tests the limits of existing legal frameworks. © 2024, IGI Global.

AB  - To effectively increase American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) representation in the psychological workforce and prepare AI/AN psychologists to serve AI/AN communities, transformation is critically needed in graduate training programs. Therefore, we provide an illustrative case example of a graduate student-led, cross-institutional Indigenous Research Group (IRG) mentored by an Indigenous faculty member. Using first-person and synthesized narratives, we summarize our transformative experience in the IRG as a journey in which we found belonging and community, culturally responsive mentorship and training, and the support to become emergent Indigenous psychologists. Informed by the student and faculty mentor reflections on the IRG, we then provide recommendations for graduate programs to support Indigenous students. Ultimately, the IRG is a testament to the creative ways Indigenous scholars navigate the academy and serves as well as a call for faculty to support the next generation of AI/AN psychologists. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - In a context of increasing application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems, understood as those foundational models of artificial intelligence intended to generate, with different levels of autonomy, content such as complex text, images or audio, the analysis of the so-called “transformative use” of artificial intelligence companies is faced. The focus is on analysing North American jurisprudence on “fair use” from the obligatory balance between creative freedom and the protection of intellectual property (copyright), with special reference to the Warhol case; as well as the commitment of the Regulation on Artificial Intelligence of the European Union (2023 text) to demand, in these cases, transparent information on the data (and its owners) used for its training. © 2024 Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.

AB  - The integration of AI in radiology raises significant legal questions about responsibility for errors. Radiologists fear AI may introduce new legal challenges, despite its potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy. AI tools, even those approved by regulatory bodies like the FDA or CE, are not perfect, posing a risk of failure. The key issue is how AI is implemented: as a stand-alone diagnostic tool or as an aid to radiologists. The latter approach could reduce undesired side effects. However, it's unclear who should be held liable for AI failures, with potential candidates ranging from engineers and radiologists involved in AI development to companies and department heads who integrate these tools into clinical practice. The EU's AI Act, recognizing AI's risks, categorizes applications by risk level, with many radiology-related AI tools considered high risk. Legal precedents in autonomous vehicles offer some guidance on assigning responsibility. Yet, the existing legal challenges in radiology, such as diagnostic errors, persist. AI's potential to improve diagnostics raises questions about the legal implications of not using available AI tools. For instance, an AI tool improving the detection of pediatric fractures could reduce legal risks. This situation parallels innovations like car turn signals, where ignoring available safety enhancements could lead to legal problems. The debate underscores the need for further research and regulation to clarify AI's role in radiology, balancing innovation with legal and ethical considerations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.
