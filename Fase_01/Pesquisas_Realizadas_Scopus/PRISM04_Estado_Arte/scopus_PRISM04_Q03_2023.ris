AB  - In 2020, the U.S. Department of Defense officially disclosed a set of ethical principles to guide the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies on future battlefields. Despite stark differences, there are core similarities between the military and medical service. Warriors on battlefields often face life-altering circumstances that require quick decision-making. Medical providers experience similar challenges in a rapidly changing healthcare environment, such as in the emergency department or during surgery treating a life-threatening condition. Generative AI, an emerging technology designed to efficiently generate valuable information, holds great promise. As computing power becomes more accessible and the abundance of health data, such as electronic health records, electrocardiograms, and medical images, increases, it is inevitable that healthcare will be revolutionized by this technology. Recently, generative AI has garnered a lot of attention in the medical research community, leading to debates about its application in the healthcare sector, mainly due to concerns about transparency and related issues. Meanwhile, questions around the potential exacerbation of health disparities due to modeling biases have raised notable ethical concerns regarding the use of this technology in healthcare. However, the ethical principles for generative AI in healthcare have been understudied. As a result, there are no clear solutions to address ethical concerns, and decision-makers often neglect to consider the significance of ethical principles before implementing generative AI in clinical practice. In an attempt to address these issues, we explore ethical principles from the military perspective and propose the “GREAT PLEA” ethical principles, namely Governability, Reliability, Equity, Accountability, Traceability, Privacy, Lawfulness, Empathy, and Eutonomy, for generative AI in healthcare. Furthermore, we introduce a framework for adopting and expanding these ethical principles in a practical way that has been useful in the military and can be applied to healthcare for generative AI, based on contrasting their ethical concerns and risks. Ultimately, we aim to proactively address the ethical dilemmas and challenges posed by the integration of generative AI into healthcare practice. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a disruptive technology that is widely adopted by members of the general public as well as scientists and technologists who are enthusiastic about the potential to accelerate research in a wide variety of fields. But some professional artists, writers, and programmers fiercely object to the use of their creations as training data for generative AI systems and to outputs that may compete with or displace their works (1, 2). Lack of attribution and compensation for use of their original creations are other sources of aggravation to critics of generative AI.  Copyright lawsuits that are now underway in the United States have substantial implications for the future of generative AI systems. If the plaintiffs prevail, the only generative AI systems that may be lawful in the United States would be those trained on public domain works or under licenses, which will affect everyone who deploys generative AI, integrates it into their products, and uses it for scientific research.

AB  - From the perspective of a descriptive analysis, and as a starting point to a new research line, this paper examines the potential impact Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) technologies may have on academic integrity, manifested in the learning and evaluation processes of law classes at the university level. The article takes as its premise the definition of academic integrity as a set of values and argues that a series of risks arise from the GAI that threaten those values, such as excessive dependence and trust in the GAI, the unreallizability of the pedagogical project and the loss of competitiveness of educational institutions, among others. To minimize or nullify such risks, and thus prevent them from affecting academic integrity, four mitigation measures are identified to be applied in university environments. © 2023 Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru.

AB  - • Three significant lawsuits concerning generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) were filed in the USA, starting the first wave of lawsuits against AI: (i) coders filed claims for the alleged use of their codes by OpenAI’s CoPilot, (ii) visual artists filed claims against companies using Stable Diffusion and (iii) Getty Images filed claims against Stability AI, which uses Stable Diffusion. Following the lead of these lawsuits, copyright owners of literary works filed four other lawsuits against OpenAI, Meta and Alphabet (Google)’s large language models. All of these lawsuits are pending at the time of writing. • Among other things, plaintiffs filed claims challenging generative AI’s lack of attribution to copyright owners of in-copyright works in its training data. As US copyright law does not protect moral rights strongly, a federal rule granting a right of attribution to all copyright owners does not exist. Yet, there are some provisions providing quasi-protection. Section 1202 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is one of them and protects copyright owners against removal/modification of the Copyright Management Information in connection with their works. • This article lays down the limitations of moral rights protection in the USA and demonstrates the difficulties faced by the plaintiffs of the pending lawsuits. The limitations of Section 1202 DMCA are explained to demonstrate its difference from a classic moral right of attribution. The outcomes of these lawsuits will be significant in building case law on generative AI for the first time in the USA. This article evaluates the benefits and disadvantages of courts’ possible acceptance of plaintiffs’ claims regarding attribution. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - [Purpose/significance] With the rapid development and wide application of generative AI, the structure of the information space undergoes a profound change. The previous information space dominated by UGC begins to be gradually influenced by AIGC, and the importance of generative AI governance becomes more and more prominent. The purpose of this paper is to compare AIGC and UGC from a thematic perspective, to reveal the differences between the two in terms of content and structural features, and to provide innovative references for generative AI governance. [Method/process] In this paper, questions and user responses on multiple online platforms in four domains, including finance, law, healthcare, and open Q&A, are collected, and AI responses for each question are generated with the help of the gpt-turbo-3. 5 model, and a corpus containing 65260 Q&A data is finally constructed. The BERTopic topic model is employed to extract topics from both AIGC and UGC datasets, and a comprehensive comparison is conducted between the two datasets from three perspectives: inter-topic relationships, topic-document relationships, and topic-subject term relationships. [Result/conclusion] The results of the study reveal the differences between AIGC and UGC in terms of topic distribution, document consistency within topics, and topic word weight structure. By gaining a deeper understanding of the characteristic differences between the two, the behavioral laws of generative AI can be better observed, and references for the improvement of the governance strategy of AIGC can be provided. © 2023 Information studies: Theory and Application.

AB  - [Purpose/significance] The powerful “human-like expression” capability demonstrated by the generative AI represented by Chat GPT has shifted the knowledge acquisition from the “Retrieval mode” to the “Generation mode” and the thinking process from “Synthesis mode” to “Selection mode” in research activities. This shift in research methods further leads to the impact of generative AI on the existing rules of research evaluation and raises the risk of low quality information output and fraudulent use by researchers in research scenarios. There is a need to improve the existing rules of research evaluation as a way to regulate the risks of research arising from generative AI. [Method/process] The literature analysis method suggests that the current academic exploration of empowerment theory from copyright-ability can hardly meet the needs of risk regulation. [Result/conclusion] A behavioral regulation model should be adopted to set up the obligations of disclosure of use, review of content, and explanation of innovation in the industry soft law, and classify the scenarios of AI use by researchers into use as a language aid, use as a fact discovery tool, and use as an idea generation tool, and assign different degrees of obligations to them according to different scenarios. © 2023 Information studies: Theory and Application.
