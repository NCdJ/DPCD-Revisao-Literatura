AB  - Recent legislation has led to interest in machine unlearning, i. e., removing specific training samples from a predictive model as if they never existed in the training dataset. Unlearning may also be required due to corrupted/adversarial data or simply a user's updated privacy requirement. For models which require no training (k-NN), simply deleting the closest original sample can be effective. But this idea is inapplicable to models which learn richer representations. Recent ideas leveraging optimization-based updates scale poorly with the model dimension d, due to inverting the Hessian of the loss function. We use a variant of a new conditional independence coefficient, L-CODEC, to identify a subset of the model parameters with the most semantic overlap on an individual sample level. Our approach completely avoids the need to invert a (possibly) huge matrix. By utilizing a Markov blanket selection, we premise that L-CODEC is also suitable for deep unlearning, as well as other applications in vision. Compared to alternatives, L-CODEC makes approximate unlearning possible in settings that would otherwise be infeasible, including vision models used for face recognition, person reidentification and NLP models that may require unlearning samples identified for exclusion.

AB  - Laws and their interpretations, legal arguments and agreements are typically expressed in writing, leading to the production of vast corpora of legal text. Their analysis, which is at the center of legal practice, becomes increasingly elaborate as these collections grow in size. Natural language understanding (NLU) technologies can be a valuable tool to support legal practitioners in these endeavors. Their usefulness, however, largely depends on whether current state-of-the-art models can generalize across various tasks in the legal domain. To answer this currently open question, we introduce the Legal General Language Understanding Evaluation (LexGLUE) benchmark, a collection of datasets for evaluating model performance across a diverse set of legal NLU tasks in a standardized way. We also provide an evaluation and analysis of several generic and legal-oriented models demonstrating that the latter consistently offer performance improvements across multiple tasks. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Purpose: The recent COVID-19 pandemic affects all segments of the population in all possible fields of life. To encounter this critical situation and to safeguard the health of the library users & library staff, the library services have been forced to adapt and accept the “new normal” and give a greater use and reliance on virtual space than ever before with physical spaces. This paper aims to demonstrate an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven solution that can be practically implemented in the form of a “InfoBot” or “Chatbot” to fulfil user needs 24/7 with minimal or without human intervention. Design/methodology/approach: To give a general overview of the use of AI Chatbot in libraries and its multitasking features followed by the practical implementation, a versatile AIchatbot service, Engati is used as a target bot with its basic free plan. Findings: The study findings reveal that AI Chatbots offer a dependable solution for the libraries to initiate virtual assistance, thus augmenting the reference service while adding a newer dimension to virtual reference service. Social implications: Innovative and intelligent information service would be overcoming the time and location barriers reaffirming the concept of “library without walls” while falling in line with the five laws of library science as propounded by Dr S.R. Ranganathan, the father of library science in India. Originality/value: Though the implementation of bots and chatbots is not a purely novel concept to explore, no such research has been conducted focusing particularly on its exceptional benefits in the library in reference to the recent pandemic. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Microfluidic-based organs-on-chips (OoCs) are a rapidly developing technology in biomedical and chemical research and have emerged as one of the most advanced and promising in vitro models. The miniaturization, stimulated tissue mechanical forces, and microenvironment of OoCs offer unique properties for biomedical applications. However, the large amount of data generated by the high parallelization of OoC systems has grown far beyond the scope of manual analysis by researchers with biomedical backgrounds. Deep learning, an emerging area of research in the field of machine learning, can automatically mine the inherent characteristics and laws of "big data" and has achieved remarkable applications in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The integration of deep learning in OoCs is an emerging field that holds enormous potential for drug development, disease modeling, and personalized medicine. This review briefly describes the basic concepts and mechanisms of microfluidics and deep learning and summarizes their successful integration. We then analyze the combination of OoCs and deep learning for image digitization, data analysis, and automation. Finally, the problems faced in current applications are discussed, and future perspectives and suggestions are provided to further strengthen this integration. © 2022 Territorios.

AB  - We present a benchmark suite of four datasets for evaluating the fairness of pre-trained language models and the techniques used to fine-tune them for downstream tasks. Our benchmarks cover four jurisdictions (European Council, USA, Switzerland, and China), five languages (English, German, French, Italian and Chinese) and fairness across five attributes (gender, age, region, language, and legal area). In our experiments, we evaluate pre-trained language models using several group-robust fine-tuning techniques and show that performance group disparities are vibrant in many cases, while none of these techniques guarantee fairness, nor consistently mitigate group disparities. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of our results, highlighting open challenges in the development of robustness methods in legal NLP. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Modeling law search and retrieval as prediction problems has recently emerged as a predominant approach in law intelligence. Focusing on the law article retrieval task, we present a deep learning framework named LamBERTa, which is designed for civil-law codes, and specifically trained on the Italian civil code. To our knowledge, this is the first study proposing an advanced approach to law article prediction for the Italian legal system based on a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) learning framework, which has recently attracted increased attention among deep learning approaches, showing outstanding effectiveness in several natural language processing and learning tasks. We define LamBERTa models by fine-tuning an Italian pre-trained BERT on the Italian civil code or its portions, for law article retrieval as a classification task. One key aspect of our LamBERTa framework is that we conceived it to address an extreme classification scenario, which is characterized by a high number of classes, the few-shot learning problem, and the lack of test query benchmarks for Italian legal prediction tasks. To solve such issues, we define different methods for the unsupervised labeling of the law articles, which can in principle be applied to any law article code system. We provide insights into the explainability and interpretability of our LamBERTa models, and we present an extensive experimental analysis over query sets of different type, for single-label as well as multi-label evaluation tasks. Empirical evidence has shown the effectiveness of LamBERTa, and also its superiority against widely used deep-learning text classifiers and a few-shot learner conceived for an attribute-aware prediction task. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Over the last decade, there has been great research interest in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields, such as medicine, finance, and law. Recently, there has been a research focus on the application of AI in education, where it has great potential. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature on AI in education is therefore necessary. This article considers its usage and applications in Latin American higher education institutions. After identifying the studies dedicated to educational innovations brought about by the application of AI techniques, this review examines AI applications in three educational processes: learning, teaching, and administration. Each study is analyzed for the AI techniques used, such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, the AI tools and algorithms that are applied, and the main education topic. The results reveal that the main AI applications in education are: predictive modelling, intelligent analytics, assistive technology, automatic content analysis, and image analytics. It is further demonstrated that AI applications help to address important education issues (e.g., detecting students at risk of dropping out) and thereby contribute to ensuring quality education. Finally, the article presents the lessons learned from the review concerning the application of AI technologies in higher education in the Latin American context. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Legal text mining is targeted at automatically analyzing the texts in the legal domain by employing various natural language processing techniques and has attracted enormous attention from the NLP community. As one of the most crucial tasks of legal text mining, Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to automatically predict judgment results (e.g., applicable law articles, charges, and terms of penalty) according to fact descriptions on law cases and becomes a promising application of artificial intelligence techniques. Unfortunately, ambiguous fact descriptions and law articles often appear due to a great number of shared words and legal concepts. Prior works are proposed to partially address these problems, focusing on introducing additional attributes to distinguish similar fact descriptions, or differentiating confusing law articles by grouping and distilling law articles. However, existing works still face two severe challenges: (1) indistinguishable fact descriptions with different criminals and targets and (2) misleading law articles with highly similar TF–IDF representations, both of which lead to serious misjudgments for the LJP task. In this paper, we present a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based framework, named Criminal Element Extraction Network (CEEN), to handle above challenges simultaneously. In CEEN, we propose four types of discriminative criminal elements, including the criminal, target, intentionality, and criminal behavior. To discriminate ambiguous fact descriptions, an reinforcement learning based extractor is designed to accurately locate elements for different cases. To enhance law article predictions, distinctive element representations are constructed for each type of criminal element. Finally, with the input of element representations, a multi-task predictor is adopted for the judgment predictions. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that extracting criminal elements is highly useful for predicting the judgment results. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are widely used in many sub-fields of natural language processing (NLP) and generally known as excellent few-shot learners with task-specific exemplars. Notably, chain of thought (CoT) prompting, a recent technique for eliciting complex multi-step reasoning through step-by-step answer examples, achieved the state-of-the-art performances in arithmetics and symbolic reasoning, difficult system-2 tasks that do not follow the standard scaling laws for LLMs. While these successes are often attributed to LLMs' ability for few-shot learning, we show that LLMs are decent zero-shot reasoners by simply adding “Let's think step by step” before each answer. Experimental results demonstrate that our Zero-shot-CoT, using the same single prompt template, significantly outperforms zero-shot LLM performances on diverse benchmark reasoning tasks including arithmetics (MultiArith, GSM8K, AQUA-RAT, SVAMP), symbolic reasoning (Last Letter, Coin Flip), and other logical reasoning tasks (Date Understanding, Tracking Shuffled Objects), without any hand-crafted few-shot examples, e.g. increasing the accuracy on MultiArith from 17.7% to 78.7% and GSM8K from 10.4% to 40.7% with large-scale InstructGPT model (text-davinci-002), as well as similar magnitudes of improvements with another off-the-shelf large model, 540B parameter PaLM. The versatility of this single prompt across very diverse reasoning tasks hints at untapped and understudied fundamental zero-shot capabilities of LLMs, suggesting high-level, multi-task broad cognitive capabilities may be extracted by simple prompting. We hope our work not only serves as the minimal strongest zero-shot baseline for the challenging reasoning benchmarks, but also highlights the importance of carefully exploring and analyzing the enormous zero-shot knowledge hidden inside LLMs before crafting finetuning datasets or few-shot exemplars. © 2022 Neural information processing systems foundation.

AB  - Industrial maintenance strategies increasingly rely on artificial intelligence to predict asset conditions and prescribe maintenance actions. The related maintenance software and human maintenance actors can form a hybrid-augmented intelligence system where each side benefits from and enhances the other side's intelligence. This system requires optimized human-machine interfaces to help users express their knowledge and retrieve information from difficult-to-use software. Therefore, this article proposes a novel approach for maintenance experts and operators to interact with a predictive maintenance system through a digital intelligent assistant. This assistant is artificial intelligence (AI) that could help its users interact with the system via natural language and collect their feedback about the success of maintenance interventions. Implementing hybrid-augmented intelligence in a predictive maintenance system faces several technical, social, economic, organizational, and legal challenges. The benefits, limitations, and risks of hybrid-augmented intelligence must be clear to all employees to advocate its use. AI-focused change management and employee training could be techniques to address these challenges. The success of the proposed approach also relies on the continuous improvement of natural language understanding. Such a process will need conversation-driven development where actual interactions with the assistant provide accurate training data for language and dialog models. Future research has to be interdisciplinary and may cover the integration of explainable AI, suitable AI laws, operationalized trustworthy AI, efficient design for human-computer interaction, and natural language processing adapted to predictive maintenance. © 2022 The Author(s)
