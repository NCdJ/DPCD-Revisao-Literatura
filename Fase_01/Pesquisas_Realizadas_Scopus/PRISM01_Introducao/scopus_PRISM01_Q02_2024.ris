AB  - Purpose: This contribution explores the underuse of artificial intelligence (AI) in the health sector, what this means for practice, and how much the underuse can cost. Attention is drawn to the relevance of an issue that the European Parliament has outlined as a "major threat" in 2020. At its heart is the risk that research and development on trusted AI systems for medicine and digital health will pile up in lab centers without generating further practical relevance. Our analysis highlights why researchers, practitioners and especially policymakers, should pay attention to this phenomenon. Methods: The paper examines the ways in which governments and public agencies are addressing the underuse of AI. As governments and international organizations often acknowledge the limitations of their own initiatives, the contribution explores the causes of the current issues and suggests ways to improve initiatives for digital health. Results: Recommendations address the development of standards, models of regulatory governance, assessment of the opportunity costs of underuse of technology, and the urgency of the problem. Conclusions: The exponential pace of AI advances and innovations makes the risks of underuse of AI increasingly threatening.

AB  - The study provides a comprehensive review of OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) technical report, with an emphasis on applications in high-risk settings like healthcare. A diverse team, including experts in artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing, public health, law, policy, social science, healthcare research, and bioethics, analyzed the report against established peer review guidelines. The GPT-4 report shows a significant commitment to transparent AI research, particularly in creating a systems card for risk assessment and mitigation. However, it reveals limitations such as restricted access to training data, inadequate confidence and uncertainty estimations, and concerns over privacy and intellectual property rights. Key strengths identified include the considerable time and economic investment in transparent AI research and the creation of a comprehensive systems card. On the other hand, the lack of clarity in training processes and data raises concerns about encoded biases and interests in GPT-4. The report also lacks confidence and uncertainty estimations, crucial in high-risk areas like healthcare, and fails to address potential privacy and intellectual property issues. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the need for diverse, global involvement in developing and evaluating large language models (LLMs) to ensure broad societal benefits and mitigate risks. The paper presents recommendations such as improving data transparency, developing accountability frameworks, establishing confidence standards for LLM outputs in high-risk settings, and enhancing industry research review processes. It concludes that while GPT-4’s report is a step towards open discussions on LLMs, more extensive interdisciplinary reviews are essential for addressing bias, harm, and risk concerns, especially in high-risk domains. The review aims to expand the understanding of LLMs in general and highlights the need for new reflection forms on how LLMs are reviewed, the data required for effective evaluation, and addressing critical issues like bias and risk. © 2024 Gallifant et al.

AB  - This paper addresses the black-box problem in artificial intelligence (AI), and the related problem of explainability of AI in the legal context. We argue, first, that the black box problem is, in fact, a superficial one as it results from an overlap of four different – albeit interconnected – issues: the opacity problem, the strangeness problem, the unpredictability problem, and the justification problem. Thus, we propose a framework for discussing both the black box problem and the explainability of AI. We argue further that contrary to often defended claims the opacity issue is not a genuine problem. We also dismiss the justification problem. Further, we describe the tensions involved in the strangeness and unpredictability problems and suggest some ways to alleviate them. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Healthcare organizations have realized that Artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a competitive edge through personalized patient experiences, improved patient outcomes, early diagnosis, augmented clinician capabilities, enhanced operational efficiencies, or improved medical service accessibility. However, deploying AI-driven tools in the healthcare ecosystem could be challenging. This paper categorizes AI applications in healthcare and comprehensively examines the challenges associated with deploying AI in medical practices at scale. As AI continues to make strides in healthcare, its integration presents various challenges, including production timelines, trust generation, privacy concerns, algorithmic biases, and data scarcity. The paper highlights that flawed business models and wrong workflows in healthcare practices cannot be rectified merely by deploying AI-driven tools. Healthcare organizations should re-evaluate root problems such as misaligned financial incentives (e.g., fee-for-service models), dysfunctional medical workflows (e.g., high rates of patient readmissions), poor care coordination between different providers, fragmented electronic health records systems, and inadequate patient education and engagement models in tandem with AI adoption. This study also explores the need for a cultural shift in viewing AI not as a threat but as an enabler that can enhance healthcare delivery and create new employment opportunities while emphasizing the importance of addressing underlying operational issues. The necessity of investments beyond finance is discussed, emphasizing the importance of human capital, continuous learning, and a supportive environment for AI integration. The paper also highlights the crucial role of clear regulations in building trust, ensuring safety, and guiding the ethical use of AI, calling for coherent frameworks addressing transparency, model accuracy, data quality control, liability, and ethics. Furthermore, this paper underscores the importance of advancing AI literacy within academia to prepare future healthcare professionals for an AI-driven landscape. Through careful navigation and proactive measures addressing these challenges, the healthcare community can harness AI's transformative power responsibly and effectively, revolutionizing healthcare delivery and patient care. The paper concludes with a vision and strategic suggestions for the future of healthcare with AI, emphasizing thoughtful, responsible, and innovative engagement as the pathway to realizing its full potential to unlock immense benefits for healthcare organizations, physicians, nurses, and patients while proactively mitigating risks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology and turned into a field of knowledge that has been consistently displacing technologies for a change in human life. It is applied in all spheres of life as reflected in the review of the literature section here. As applicable in the field of libraries too, this study scientifically mapped the papers on AAIL and analyze its growth, collaboration network, trending topics, or research hot spots to highlight the challenges and opportunities in adopting AI-based advancements in library systems and processes. Design/methodology/approach: The study was developed with a bibliometric approach, considering a decade, 2012 to 2021 for data extraction from a premier database, Scopus. The steps followed are (1) identification, selection of keywords, and forming the search strategy with the approval of a panel of computer scientists and librarians and (2) design and development of a perfect algorithm to verify these selected keywords in title-abstract-keywords of Scopus (3) Performing data processing in some state-of-the-art bibliometric visualization tools, Biblioshiny R and VOSviewer (4) discussing the findings for practical implications of the study and limitations. Findings: As evident from several papers, not much research has been conducted on AI applications in libraries in comparison to topics like AI applications in cancer, health, medicine, education, and agriculture. As per the Price law, the growth pattern is exponential. The total number of papers relevant to the subject is 1462 (single and multi-authored) contributed by 5400 authors with 0.271 documents per author and around 4 authors per document. Papers occurred mostly in open-access journals. The productive journal is the Journal of Chemical Information and Modelling (NP = 63) while the highly consistent and impactful is the Journal of Machine Learning Research (z-index=63.58 and CPP = 56.17). In the case of authors, J Chen (z-index=28.86 and CPP = 43.75) is the most consistent and impactful author. At the country level, the USA has recorded the highest number of papers positioned at the center of the co-authorship network but at the institutional level, China takes the 1st position. The trending topics of research are machine learning, large dataset, deep learning, high-level languages, etc. The present information system has a high potential to improve if integrated with AI technologies. Practical implications: The number of scientific papers has increased over time. The evolution of themes like machine learning implicates AI as a broad field of knowledge that converges with other disciplines. The themes like large datasets imply that AI may be applied to analyze and interpret these data and support decision-making in public sector enterprises. Theme named high-level language emerged as a research hotspot which indicated that extensive research has been going on in this area to improve computer systems for facilitating the processing of data with high momentum. These implications are of high strategic worth for policymakers, library stakeholders, researchers and the government as a whole for decision-making. Originality/value: The analysis of collaboration, prolific authors/journals using consistency factor and CPP, testing the relationship between consistency (z-index) and impact (h-index), using state-of-the-art network visualization and cluster analysis techniques make this study novel and differentiates it from the traditional bibliometric analysis. To the best of the author's knowledge, this work is the first attempt to comprehend the research streams and provide a holistic view of research on the application of AI in libraries. The insights obtained from this analysis are instrumental for both academics and practitioners. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The main aim of this research is to identify and prevent fraudulent activities which can be achieved through AI related to facial recognition systems. Nowadays the usage of facial recognition systems is very high, and in the same way the scams by fraudsters are also increased in this research by using AI bots instead of humans. The main motive of this research is to identify the misuse of facial recognition technology. The proposed method using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) protects the individual privacy of people and their data. It detects whether the character in the image is an AI made or real human. This helps to ensure that only authorized people can use their information. Some of the sectors which use facial recognition systems are security, law enforcement, financial services, education, government services, retail. if unauthorized people access the above-mentioned sectors, the result will be imperiling. This method takes an image as an input and then python is used to process the image, importing a CV library to do this job. Next, we use deep learning models in python to identify whether the character in the image is AI generated or real human.

AB  - The availability of unprecedented unsupervised training data, along with neural scaling laws, has resulted in an unprecedented surge in model size and compute requirements for serving/training large language models. However, the main performance bottleneck is increasingly shifting to memory bandwidth. Over the past 20 years, peak server hardware floating-point operations per second have been scaling at 3.0×Ã - per two years, outpacing the growth of dynamic random-access memory and interconnect bandwidth, which have only scaled at 1.6 and 1.4 times every two years, respectively. This disparity has made memory, rather than compute, the primary bottleneck in AI applications, particularly in serving. Here, we analyze encoder and decoder transformer models and show how memory bandwidth can become the dominant bottleneck for decoder models. We argue for a redesign in model architecture, training, and deployment strategies to overcome this memory limitation.  © 1981-2012 IEEE.

AB  - A physics-informed neural network (PINN) uses physics-Augmented loss functions, e.g., incorporating the residual term from governing partial differential equations (PDEs), to ensure its output is consistent with fundamental physics laws. However, it turns out to be difficult to train an accurate PINN model for many problems in practice. In this article, we present a novel perspective of the merits of learning in sinusoidal spaces with PINNs. By analyzing behavior at model initialization, we first show that a PINN of increasing expressiveness induces an initial bias around flat output functions. Notably, this initial solution can be very close to satisfying many physics PDEs, i.e., falling into a localminimum of the PINN loss that onlyminimizes PDE residuals, while still being far from the true solution that jointly minimizes PDE residuals and the initial and/or boundary conditions. It is difficult for gradient descent optimization to escape from such a local minimum trap, often causing the training to stall. We then prove that the sinusoidalmapping of inputs-in an architecture we label as sf-PINN-is effective to increase input gradient variability, thus avoiding being trapped in such deceptive local minimum. The level of variability can be effectively modulated to match high-frequency patterns in the problem at hand. A key facet of this article is the comprehensive empirical study that demonstrates the efficacy of learning in sinusoidal spaces with PINNs for a wide range of forward and inversemodeling problems spanning multiple physics domains. Impact Statement-Falling under the emerging field of physicsinformed machine learning, PINN models have tremendous potential as a unifying AI framework for assimilating physics theory and measurement data. However, they remain infeasible for broad science and engineering applications due to computational cost and training challenges, especially for more complex problems. Instead of focusing on empirical demonstration of applicability to a specific problem, this paper analyzed and provided novel perspectives on why a typical PINN implementation frequently exhibits training difficulty, even on a seemingly straightforward 1D model problem. Interestingly, the issues uncovered explain how common heuristics for data-fit neural networks (e.g. initialization) cause training difficulties in this new paradigm of PINNs. Critically, we believe this to be among the first work to analytically provide insight into how simply adapting conventional neural network implementations may be broadly problematic for PINNs across different PDEs (physics). Guided by this insight, we then further provide theoretical results on the benefit of learning in sinusoidal space with PINNs. Utilizing sinusoidal spaces initializes sf-PINNs with input gradient distributions that can overcome the trainability issues uncovered, and this is further demonstrated by a comprehensive empirical study for a wide range of forward and inverse modelling problems spanning multiple physics domains. sf-PINNs can significantly improve the model accuracy by a few orders of magnitudes. Our paper also provides a theoretical foundation for unifying and explaining purported benefits from previously published empirical works, thereby advancing our understanding of this new PINN paradigm. © 2024 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..
