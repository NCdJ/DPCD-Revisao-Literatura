AB  - In this paper, we discuss previous research in automatic prediction of court decisions. We define the difference between outcome identification, outcome-based judgement categorisation and outcome forecasting, and review how various studies fall into these categories. We discuss how important it is to understand the legal data that one works with in order to determine which task can be performed. Finally, we reflect on the needs of the legal discipline regarding the analysis of court judgements. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Additive manufacturing facilitates producing of complex parts due to its design freedom in a wide range of applications. Despite considerable advancements in additive manufacturing techniques, 3D-printed parts are still suffering from durability, repeatability, and reliability. One main reason, which increases the complexity of the problem and causes defects during manufacturing, is the high number of processing parameters. Machine learning approaches seem to be a promising solution to tackle the challenges in the additive manufacturing field. This paper employs a systematic literature review by employing natural language processing and text mining techniques to analyze the recent advancement in the application of machine learning in porosity detection and prediction in 3D-printed parts. Two methods of text analytics are used to evaluate different avenues of research in additive manufacturing. Most frequent machine learning methods employed to evaluate the porosity formed in the 3D-printed parts are introduced and classified based on their applications. Recent advancements in developing hybrid machine learning models reveal the importance of physical domain knowledge (e.g., thermomechanical laws and constraints) in these models and their accuracy. Eventually, challenges and opportunities that exist for the next generation of machine learning techniques in the AM field are identified and summarized. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Federated learning models are collaboratively developed upon valuable training data owned by multiple parties. During the development and deployment of federated models, they are exposed to risks including illegal copying, re-distribution, misuse and/or free-riding. To address these risks, the ownership verification of federated learning models is a prerequisite that protects federated learning model intellectual property rights (IPR) i.e., FedIPR. We propose a novel federated deep neural network (FedDNN) ownership verification scheme that allows private watermarks to be embedded and verified to claim legitimate IPR of FedDNN models. In the proposed scheme, each client independently verifies the existence of the model watermarks and claims respective ownership of the federated model without disclosing neither private training data nor private watermark information. The effectiveness of embedded watermarks is theoretically justified by the rigorous analysis of conditions under which watermarks can be privately embedded and detected by multiple clients. Moreover, extensive experimental results on computer vision and natural language processing tasks demonstrate that varying bit-length watermarks can be embedded and reliably detected without compromising original model performances. Our watermarking scheme is also resilient to various federated training settings and robust against removal attacks.  © 1979-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks often handle private data, demanding protection against breaches and disclosures. Data protection laws, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), thereby enforce the need for privacy. Although many privacy-preserving NLP methods have been proposed in recent years, no categories to organize them have been introduced yet, making it hard to follow the progress of the literature. To close this gap, this article systematically reviews over sixty DL methods for privacy-preserving NLP published between 2016 and 2020, covering theoretical foundations, privacy-enhancing technologies, and analysis of their suitability for real-world scenarios. First, we introduce a novel taxonomy for classifying the existing methods into three categories: data safeguarding methods, trusted methods, and verification methods. Second, we present an extensive summary of privacy threats, datasets for applications, and metrics for privacy evaluation. Third, throughout the review, we describe privacy issues in the NLP pipeline in a holistic view. Further, we discuss open challenges in privacy-preserving NLP regarding data traceability, computation overhead, dataset size, the prevalence of human biases in embeddings, and the privacy-utility tradeoff. Finally, this review presents future research directions to guide successive research and development of privacy-preserving NLP models. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The progress of some AI paradigms such as deep learning is said to be linked to an exponential growth in the number of parameters. There are many studies corroborating these trends, but does this translate into an exponential increase in energy consumption? In order to answer this question we focus on inference costs rather than training costs, as the former account for most of the computing effort, solely because of the multiplicative factors. Also, apart from algorithmic innovations, we account for more specific and powerful hardware (leading to higher FLOPS) that is usually accompanied with important energy efficiency optimisations. We also move the focus from the first implementation of a breakthrough paper towards the consolidated version of the techniques one or two year later. Under this distinctive and comprehensive perspective, we analyse relevant models in the areas of computer vision and natural language processing: for a sustained increase in performance we see a much softer growth in energy consumption than previously anticipated. The only caveat is, yet again, the multiplicative factor, as future AI increases penetration and becomes more pervasive. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: ChatGPT, a large language model, has shown good performance on physician certification examinations and medical consultations. However, its performance has not been examined in languages other than English or on nursing examinations. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on the Japanese National Nurse Examinations. Methods: We evaluated the percentages of correct answers provided by ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) for all questions on the Japanese National Nurse Examinations from 2019 to 2023, excluding inappropriate questions and those containing images. Inappropriate questions were pointed out by a third-party organization and announced by the government to be excluded from scoring. Specifically, these include “questions with inappropriate question difficulty” and “questions with errors in the questions or choices.” These examinations consist of 240 questions each year, divided into basic knowledge questions that test the basic issues of particular importance to nurses and general questions that test a wide range of specialized knowledge. Furthermore, the questions had 2 types of formats: simple-choice and situation-setup questions. Simple-choice questions are primarily knowledge-based and multiple-choice, whereas situation-setup questions entail the candidate reading a patient’s and family situation’s description, and selecting the nurse's action or patient's response. Hence, the questions were standardized using 2 types of prompts before requesting answers from ChatGPT. Chi-square tests were conducted to compare the percentage of correct answers for each year's examination format and specialty area related to the question. In addition, a Cochran-Armitage trend test was performed with the percentage of correct answers from 2019 to 2023. Results: The 5-year average percentage of correct answers for ChatGPT was 75.1% (SD 3%) for basic knowledge questions and 64.5% (SD 5%) for general questions. The highest percentage of correct answers on the 2019 examination was 80% for basic knowledge questions and 71.2% for general questions. ChatGPT met the passing criteria for the 2019 Japanese National Nurse Examination and was close to passing the 2020-2023 examinations, with only a few more correct answers required to pass. ChatGPT had a lower percentage of correct answers in some areas, such as pharmacology, social welfare, related law and regulations, endocrinology/metabolism, and dermatology, and a higher percentage of correct answers in the areas of nutrition, pathology, hematology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, dentistry and dental surgery, and nursing integration and practice. Conclusions: ChatGPT only passed the 2019 Japanese National Nursing Examination during the most recent 5 years. Although it did not pass the examinations from other years, it performed very close to the passing level, even in those containing questions related to psychology, communication, and nursing. © Kazuya Taira, Takahiro Itaya, Ayame Hanada.

AB  - In populous countries, pending legal cases have been growing exponentially. There is a need for developing NLP-based techniques for processing and automatically understanding legal documents. To promote research in the area of Legal NLP we organized the shared task LegalEval - Understanding Legal Texts at SemEval 2023. LegalEval task has three sub-tasks: Task-A (Rhetorical Roles Labeling) is about automatically structuring legal documents into semantically coherent units, Task-B (Legal Named Entity Recognition) deals with identifying relevant entities in a legal document and Task-C (Court Judgement Prediction with Explanation) explores the possibility of automatically predicting the outcome of a legal case along with providing an explanation for the prediction. In total 26 teams (approx. 100 participants spread across the world) submitted systems paper. In each of the sub-tasks, the proposed systems outperformed the baselines; however, there is a lot of scope for improvement. This paper describes the tasks, and analyzes techniques proposed by various teams. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Background: Large language models, such as ChatGPT by OpenAI, have demonstrated potential in various applications, including medical education. Previous studies have assessed ChatGPT’s performance in university or professional settings. However, the model’s potential in the context of standardized admission tests remains unexplored. Objective: This study evaluated ChatGPT’s performance on standardized admission tests in the United Kingdom, including the BioMedical Admissions Test (BMAT), Test of Mathematics for University Admission (TMUA), Law National Aptitude Test (LNAT), and Thinking Skills Assessment (TSA), to understand its potential as an innovative tool for education and test preparation. Methods: Recent public resources (2019-2022) were used to compile a data set of 509 questions from the BMAT, TMUA, LNAT, and TSA covering diverse topics in aptitude, scientific knowledge and applications, mathematical thinking and reasoning, critical thinking, problem-solving, reading comprehension, and logical reasoning. This evaluation assessed ChatGPT’s performance using the legacy GPT-3.5 model, focusing on multiple-choice questions for consistency. The model’s performance was analyzed based on question difficulty, the proportion of correct responses when aggregating exams from all years, and a comparison of test scores between papers of the same exam using binomial distribution and paired-sample (2-tailed) t tests. Results: The proportion of correct responses was significantly lower than incorrect ones in BMAT section 2 (P<.001) and TMUA paper 1 (P<.001) and paper 2 (P<.001). No significant differences were observed in BMAT section 1 (P=.2), TSA section 1 (P=.7), or LNAT papers 1 and 2, section A (P=.3). ChatGPT performed better in BMAT section 1 than section 2 (P=.047), with a maximum candidate ranking of 73% compared to a minimum of 1%. In the TMUA, it engaged with questions but had limited accuracy and no performance difference between papers (P=.6), with candidate rankings below 10%. In the LNAT, it demonstrated moderate success, especially in paper 2’s questions; however, student performance data were unavailable. TSA performance varied across years with generally moderate results and fluctuating candidate rankings. Similar trends were observed for easy to moderate difficulty questions (BMAT section 1, P=.3; BMAT section 2, P=.04; TMUA paper 1, P<.001; TMUA paper 2, P=.003; TSA section 1, P=.8; and LNAT papers 1 and 2, section A, P>.99) and hard to challenging ones (BMAT section 1, P=.7; BMAT section 2, P<.001; TMUA paper 1, P=.007; TMUA paper 2, P<.001; TSA section 1, P=.3; and LNAT papers 1 and 2, section A, P=.2). Conclusions: ChatGPT shows promise as a supplementary tool for subject areas and test formats that assess aptitude, problem-solving and critical thinking, and reading comprehension. However, its limitations in areas such as scientific and mathematical knowledge and applications highlight the need for continuous development and integration with conventional learning strategies in order to fully harness its potential. ©Panagiotis Giannos, Orestis Delardas.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has many applications in various aspects of our daily life, including health, criminal, education, civil, business, and liability law. One aspect of AI that has gained significant attention is natural language processing (NLP), which refers to the ability of computers to understand and generate human language. Objective: This study aims to examine the potential for, and concerns of, using AI in scientific research. For this purpose, high-impact research articles were generated by analyzing the quality of reports generated by ChatGPT and assessing the application’s impact on the research framework, data analysis, and the literature review. The study also explored concerns around ownership and the integrity of research when using AI-generated text. Methods: A total of 4 articles were generated using ChatGPT, and thereafter evaluated by 23 reviewers. The researchers developed an evaluation form to assess the quality of the articles generated. Additionally, 50 abstracts were generated using ChatGPT and their quality was evaluated. The data were subjected to ANOVA and thematic analysis to analyze the qualitative data provided by the reviewers. Results: When using detailed prompts and providing the context of the study, ChatGPT would generate high-quality research that could be published in high-impact journals. However, ChatGPT had a minor impact on developing the research framework and data analysis. The primary area needing improvement was the development of the literature review. Moreover, reviewers expressed concerns around ownership and the integrity of the research when using AI-generated text. Nonetheless, ChatGPT has a strong potential to increase human productivity in research and can be used in academic writing. Conclusions: AI-generated text has the potential to improve the quality of high-impact research articles. The findings of this study suggest that decision makers and researchers should focus more on the methodology part of the research, which includes research design, developing research tools, and analyzing data in depth, to draw strong theoretical and practical implications, thereby establishing a revolution in scientific research in the era of AI. The practical implications of this study can be used in different fields such as medical education to deliver materials to develop the basic competencies for both medicine students and faculty members. ©Zuheir N Khlaif, Allam Mousa, Muayad Kamal Hattab, Jamil Itmazi, Amjad A Hassan, Mageswaran Sanmugam, Abedalkarim Ayyoub.
