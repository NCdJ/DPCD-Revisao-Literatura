AB  - The use of generative AI systems is on the rise. As a result, we are increasingly often conversing with AI chatbots rather than with fellow humans. This increasing use of AI systems leads to legal challenges as well, particularly when the chatbot provides incorrect information. In this article, we study whether someone who decides to contract on the basis of incorrect information provided by a generative AI chatbot might invoke the fraud regime to annul the resulting contract in various legal systems. During this analysis, it becomes clear that some of the requirements that are currently being put forward from a public law perspective, such as in the European AI Act, may also naturally arise from existing private law figures. In the same vein, this analysis highlights the interesting intradisciplinary feedback between instruments of public law and other legal domains.

AB  - The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to aid legal decision making has become prominent. This paper investigates the use of AI in a critical issue in employment law, the determination of a worker's status-employee vs. independent contractor-in two common law countries (the U.S. and Canada). This legal question has been a contentious labor issue insofar as independent contractors are not eligible for the same benefits as employees. It has become an important societal issue due to the ubiquity of the gig economy and the recent disruptions in employment arrangements. To address this problem, we collected, annotated, and structured the data for all Canadian and Californian court cases related to this legal question between 2002 and 2021, resulting in 538 Canadian cases and 217 U.S. cases. In contrast to legal literature focusing on complex and correlated characteristics of the employment relationship, our statistical analyses of the data show very strong correlations between the worker's status and a small subset of quantifiable characteristics of the employment relationship. In fact, despite the variety of situations in the case law, we show that simple, off-the-shelf AI models classify the cases with an out-of-sample accuracy of more than 90%. Interestingly, the analysis of misclassified cases reveals consistent misclassification patterns by most algorithms. Legal analyses of these cases led us to identify how equity is ensured by judges in ambiguous situations. Finally, our findings have practical implications for access to legal advice and justice. We deployed our AI model via the open-access platform, https://MyOpenCourt.org/, to help users answer employment legal questions. This platform has already assisted many Canadian users, and we hope it will help democratize access to legal advice to large crowds.

AB  - This study examines the role of Artificial Intelligence (hereinafter "AI") in revolutionizing international trade law and the World Trade Organization (hereinafter "WTO")'s dispute resolution mechanisms. By automating complex decisions and processing extensive datasets, AI promises to enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of trade and dispute resolution. This research delves into AI's potential applications within the WTO, highlighting how predictive analytics and decision support systems could transform trade dispute resolutions. However, the integration of AI also presents challenges, including ethical concerns, the need for transparency, and data privacy issues. Balancing these challenges with the benefits of AI is crucial to maintaining fairness and accuracy in legal processes. This paper advocates for international collaboration to establish standards guiding AI applications in international trade and dispute resolution, ensuring that technological advancements support the WTO's goals without compromising the integrity of the legal system. A new legal framework is essential to harness the full potential of AI while mitigating associated risks, ensuring that advancements in AI contribute to a more equitable, efficient, and transparent global trade system. Emphasizing the broader implications, the integration of AI technologies is posited as a cornerstone for promoting free trade and opening up the world economy. By reducing barriers and enhancing access, AI has the potential to drive global economic integration and foster a more interconnected market environment. This vision aligns with contemporary global trade objectives, advocating for a harmonious blend of technology and traditional trade principles to navigate the complexities of modern international relations and trade policies. The exploration of AI's role across these dimensions underscores the broad and impactful nature of technological progress on the fabric of international trade and law, echoing the urgent call for adaptive strategies that embrace technological advancements while upholding the principles of free and fair trade.

TI  - AI inventors: deference for legal personality without respect for innovation?
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW & PRACTICE
LA  - English
AB  - This article provides insights into current developments in relation to artificial intelligence (AI) inventors, discussing recent case law and placing it in the context of legal personality and patent justification theory. Legal personality is the cornerstone of the operation of law and legal systems. Similarly, innovation provides the core justification for intellectual property rights. AI systems have demonstrated the ability to produce novel inventions. Ordinarily, the inventor would be the recipient of patents for their inventions. However, AI systems lack legal personality. Thus, should patent law protect inventions made by inventors lacking legal personality? We analyse three jurisdictions-the UK, the US and Australia-and their respective approaches to AI inventors, to explore the conflict between legal personality questions and innovation. The article argues that legal personality is essential for the grant of patent rights and that refusing the entitlement of AI systems to patents is the correct approach. It further argues that statutory reform would be desirable to focus on ensuring that the end user of AI systems is adequately incentivised to create inventions beneficial to society.

TI  - APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS IN CRIMINAL PROCEDURE: KEY AREAS, BASIC LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND PROBLEMS OF CORRELATION WITH FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS
T2  - ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN EASTERN EUROPE
LA  - English
KW  - human rights
KW  - criminal proceedings
KW  - digital technologies
KW  - artificial intelligence
KW  - predictive justice, Ukraine
AB  - Background: Digital technologies are an important factor currently driving society' development in various areas, affecting not only traditional spheres, such as medicine, manufacturing, and education, but also legal relations, including criminal proceedings. This is not just about using technologies related to videoconferencing, automated distribution, digital evidence, etc. Development is constantly and rapidly moving forward, and we are now facing issues related to the use of artificial intelligence technologies in criminal proceedings. Such changes also entail new threats and challenges - we are referring to the challenges of respecting fundamental human rights and freedoms in the context of technological development. In addition, there is the matter of ensuring the implementation of basic legal principles, such as the presumption of innocence, non-discrimination and the protection of the right to privacy. This concern arises when applying artificial intelligence systems in the criminal justice system.
   Methods: The general philosophical framework of this research consisted of axiological and hermeneutic approaches, which allowed us to conduct a value analysis of fundamental human rights and changes in their perception in the context of the AI application, as well as apply in-depth study and interpretation of legal texts. While building up the system of the basic principles of using AI systems in criminal justice, we used the system-structural and logical methods of research. The study also relied on the comparative law method in terms of comparing legal regulation and law enforcement practice in different legal systems. The method of legal modelling was applied to emphasise the main areas of possible application of AI systems in criminal proceedings.
   Results and Conclusions: The article identifies the main possible vectors of the use of artificial intelligence systems in criminal proceedings and assesses the feasibility and prospects of their implementation. In addition, it is stated that only using AI systems for auxiliary purposes carries minimal risks of interference with human rights and freedoms. Instead, other areas of AI adoption may significantly infringe rights and freedoms, and therefore the use of AI for such purposes should be fully controlled, verified and only subsidiary, and in certain cases, prohibited altogether.

KW  - Law and Time Travel
KW  - Artificial Intelligence
KW  - Emotional Intelligence and the Law
AB  - Science fiction and time travel can be used to inform and enhance the education of law students in profound ways. Within the broader field of law and literature, the relationship between law and science fiction, especially time travel stories, is rich and useful. Themes and concepts in time travel can be applied in the exploration of existing legal philosophies as well as a more expansive and engaging study of power, authority, freedom, and a number of global issues. As governments and people worldwide wrestle with climate change, armed conflict, pandemics, and the increasing significance of artificial intelligence and other advances in technology, time travel stories give students unique contexts in which to consider what law is and the degree to which it defines human experience. For generations, brilliant science fiction writers have offered thought-provoking stories and worlds that law professors and their students can use to reimagine legal thought and practice. Like its close relatives, mythology and fantasy, the science fiction genre is untethered to current social or political experience or projections necessarily corrupted by narrowly conceived historical perspectives. Science fiction writers are interested in illuminating possibilities by considering identifiable problems in unidentifiable environments. It is no accident that gender identity, racism, reproductive rights, extremist ideologies, global health crises, and various recognizable forms of labor exploitation are addressed in provocative and insightful ways by a number of the best science fiction writers. Law has a strong presence in their work. Judges, law givers, ruling groups, and other less familiar forms of power and control appear in these stories and help to move and shape the experience of the time traveler. Law students can draw on the work of these writers to consider old questions in new and refreshingly broad ways. The importance of communication and access to information are also strong themes common to law and science fiction. How are concepts of truth and propaganda significant to power? Is truth necessary for legitimacy? Information technologies introduced in the science fiction world now exist in real time in forms and with speed and volume unimagined even a few decades ago. As artificial intelligence becomes dominant in many aspects of our daily lives, law students must consider how it may change law making, court procedures, entire legal systems, and perhaps even concepts of justice. As a project, law students might develop a case and conduct a trial using an AI judge or try a case to an AI jury. How human is the law? The role of emotional intelligence and concepts like mercy, restorative justice, forgiveness, or retribution are also things they might explore in seminars or other classes using science fiction literature and other time travel media as a framework.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has started to impact many facets of the economy and people's routine activities. This article contributes to our understanding of how the legal system is reacting to the ongoing uptake of AI and the disputes or right infringements this uptake creates. Select legal cases regarding the use of AI technology for automated decisions are reviewed, with a focus on filings in Europe and the USA. This exercise reveals which type of legal challenges can be expected when it comes to deploying automated systems in these jurisdictions. Additionally, incipient regulatory efforts targeting AI on both sides of the North Atlantic are introduced and briefly discussed. The paper sheds light on how different legal systems accommodate an emerging technology with disruptive potential and offers a mapping of exemplary legal risks for prospective actors or organisations seeking to develop and deploy AI.

AB  - The use of digital technologies in administrative courts uses the legal systems of the European Union and the world to strengthen the ways of protecting human rights. This paper examines certain problems of legal regulation of the use of artificial intelligence technologies in administrative judicial procedure. The methodology of this work is based on an interdisciplinary approach using comparative legal, dialectical and systemic methods. The main objective of this article is to determine the forms and directions, risks and benefits, prospects for the use of artificial intelligence in administrative judicial procedure, taking into account foreign experience in legal regulation in this area. The concept of "artificial intelligence" is investigated. It is emphasized that the use of artificial intelligence technologies in administrative judicial procedure is an acceptable use only of specialized intelligent systems that can work under human control. It is stated that when considering administrative cases in an administrative court of minor complexity, it is possible to use artificial intelligence technologies, which will be able to independently generalize and analyze legislation, judicial practice and be a recommendation for a judge when making a fair and lawful decision on the principles of the rule of law. It has been established that the use of artificial intelligence technologies in administrative proceedings provides opportunities for the effective implementation of the right to judicial protection, but can be used to take actions that are contrary to the rule of law, in particular regarding the violation of the right to a fair trial in administrative cases in administrative courts. The latter requires the improvement of legal regulation of the use of artificial intelligence technologies in administrative judicial procedure using international principles and standards.

T2  - AUSTRALIAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly becoming a subject of, and contributor to, innovation across industries. These AI-related inventions raise important intellectual property (IP) law issues, most notably under copyright and patent law. Copyright law must grapple with the issue of "AI as author" and patent law faces the issue of "AI as inventor". AI also raises novel challenges for patent law's subject matter eligibility, non-obviousness and disclosure requirements. Additionally, AI implementers and other data owners should consider how IP can protect data - the fundamental ingredient of all AI systems. As AI continues to rapidly transform every industry and field of innovation, AI implementers and data owners should take proactive steps to stay ahead of the curve in adapting to corresponding changes in available IP protection for their AI and data assets. This article provides AI implementers with 10 practical steps to begin the process of optimising their AI- related IP.

AB  - AI-driven technology is becoming an integral part of our daily lives, spanning from smart home devices to social media platforms. However, the uneven distribution of AI technologies could result in a scenario where certain groups exert dominance over the direction of AI development. The consequences of inequality in AI evolution could further exacerbate existing economic gaps by concentrating benefits among a privileged few with access to advanced AI technologies. To address this question the, international communities should come forward and regulate the just development of AI with new and existing international laws. Although the existing international legal frameworks can be adapted to address AI-specific issues without the need for entirely new laws, however, the novel challenges presented by AI require unique and new international laws. Issues such as data sovereignty, data privacy, and data localization are areas where international laws and agreements need to evolve to accommodate the just development of AI.

AB  - This contribution outlines a research proposal combining ethical guidelines on AI and a law-as-data approach. Building upon the definitions of soft law discussed in legal scholarship, it proposes a way of structuring the regulatory landscape on AI and of addressing the question of what is included in the "soft law of AI" today. By adopting a building-blocks approach (combining distinct definitional components of soft law), the paper shows that the state of current soft law on AI depends on which position on international law one defends. Concretely, the paper firstly offers a complete codebook for identifying the different types of soft law. Secondly, it applies this codebook as a proof-of-concept for the research proposal by analyzing 40+ ethical guidelines and by clustering preliminary results according to the actor enacting the guidelines and the legally relevant effects they could deploy. Four paradigmatic types of soft law emerge: statist and international organization soft law, process-oriented soft law, expertise -oriented soft law, and de facto relevant standards soft law. These results illustrate the contributions which are to be expected from a law-as-data research proposal.

AB  - The interaction between artificial intelligence and intellectual property rights (IPRs) is one of the key areas of development in intellectual property law. After much, albeit selective, debate, it seems to be gaining increasing practical relevance through intense AI-related market activity, an initial set of case law on the matter, and policy initiatives by international organizations and lawmakers. Against this background, Zurich University's Center for Intellectual Property and Competition Law is conducting, together with the Swiss Intellectual Property Institute, a research and policy project that explores the future of intellectual property law in an AI context. This paper briefly describes the AI/IP Research Project and presents an initial set of policy recommendations for the development of IP law with a view to AI. The recommendations address topics such as AI inventorship in patent law; AI authorship in copyright law; the need for sui generis rights to protect innovative AI output; rules for the allocation of AI-related IPRs; IP protection carve-outs in order to facilitate AI system development, training, and testing; the use of AI tools by IP offices; and suitable software protection and data usage regimes.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has an important role in digital transformation worldwide, including in Indonesia. AI itself is a simulation of human intelligence that is modeled in machines and programmed to think like humans. At the time AI and the Internet of Things are connected, it can, in principle, act on data without the need for human intervention. AI was originally created by humans as a consequence of the massive digital revolution. Recently, AI has also developed rapidly to perform functions like humans and even produce works of intellectual property like humans, such as creating songs, making new inventions, making industrial designs, and so on. Thus, it is a question whether AI can be qualified as a legal subject of creator, inventor or designer and then register as intellectual property. This research answers this question from the perspective of Indonesian law based on Copyright Law, Patent Law, Industrial Design Law, as well as Trademark Law, and Geographical Indications as the existing Indonesian laws.

TI  - 'AI is not an Inventor': <i>Thaler</i> v <i>Comptroller of Patents, Designs and Trademarks</i> and the Patentability of AI Inventions
T2  - MODERN LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - The increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in inventive processes raises numerous patent law issues, including whether AI can be an inventor under law and who owns the AI-generated inventions. The UK Supreme Court decision in Thaler v Comptroller of Patents, Designs and Trademarks has provided an ultimate answer to this question: AI cannot be an inventor for the purposes of patent law. This note argues, first, that while such a human-centric approach to inventorship might discourage the use and development of AI technologies with autonomous invention capabilities, it will help retain an active human involvement in technologically supported inventive processes and continuously foster human ingenuity. Second, despite the Court focusing on what patent law is and not on what the law should be, the decision will be influential in the ongoing discussions on the future of patent law and will make it more difficult to expand patent law to incorporate non-human inventors. Third, the decision has opened, or revealed, the gaps in patent law that the emergence of AI technologies have created and for which new legal solutions will be needed, especially with relation to the ownership of AI-assisted inventions and the validation of inventorship claims.

AB  - In this article, I consider how fears of the future operation and use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the exercise of constitutional power and how the depiction of AI in science fiction may play a role in determining future conceptions of the Rule of Law. Through its role in limiting the exercise of arbitrary power, the Rule of Law plays a crucial role in society. Where popular Rule of Law conceptions were frequently shaped by their authors' fears, the Rule of Law is a product of fear. The operation of AI in society is also tainted by fear. This fear is exacerbated by science fiction accounts that frequently portray AI as complicit in a dystopian future. This portrayal of AI's role is capable of generating a state of fear in society that assists in priming society to accept a different form of the Rule of Law in the future. In other words, where contemporary ideas of the Rule of Law are shaped by fear, and where fear exists in relation to AI's exercise of constitutional power (and where this is influenced by depictions of AI in science fiction), fears associated with AI's exercise of power may shape future conceptions of the Rule of Law.

KW  - EU labour law
KW  - occupational health and safety
KW  - non-discrimination
KW  - worker protection
AB  - In April 2021, the European Commission published its first draft of the Proposal for a Regulation on Artificial Intelligence. Since AI in the work context has increasingly become important in organising work and managing workers, the AI Act will undoubtedly have an impact on EU and national labour law systems. One aim of the proposal is to guarantee 'consistency with existing Union legislation applicable to sectors where high-risk Artificial Intelligence systems are already used or likely to be used in the near future', which includes the EU social acquis. It could be argued that ensuring true consistency with EU law means guaranteeing that the way the AI Act will be implemented and applied will still allow the other pieces of EU labour law to fulfil their purpose. It is undeniable that the implementation of the AI Act will overlap with various fields of EU law, especially considering the increasing use of AI technology at work. Thus, this article seeks to identify ways to refine the AI Act, insofar as it impacts work. The contribution discusses the current AI Act as proposed in April 2021, thereby focusing on two particular areas, EU non-discrimination law and EU law on occupational health and safety (OSH), as these two areas are, more or less explicitly, addressed as legal fields in the AI Act. The article starts with taking the perspective of EU labour law influencing the development of AI systems used in the employment context. We argue that providers should respect EU labour law throughout the development of the AI system (section 2). Then, the areas where EU labour law and the AI overlap are identified, thereby viewing it from an employer's perspective, i.e., the user of the AI system (section 3). Using two specific EU labour law areas (the right not to be discriminated against and the right to healthy and safe working conditions) the article provides a first assessment of how the AI Act might influence work and the regulation thereof (section 4). Finally, the conclusion critically explores whether and to what extent AI in employment situations warrants particular attention (section 5).

LA  - English
KW  - Artificial intelligence
KW  - Extraterritorial effects
KW  - Global governance
AB  - The extraterritorial application of artificial intelligence (AI) laws and regulations is a form of global AI governance. The EU and China serve as two different examples of how to achieve the extraterritorial applicability of AI laws and regulations. The former shows an explicit territorial extension with more trigger factors, whereas the latter shows vertical regulation with a narrower territorial scope. Both countries' legislative motivations differ but also have some commonalities. One of the primary goals of extraterritorial application of domestic laws is to protect citizens within their territory. The digital economy's characteristics make it necessary for AI laws to have extraterritorial effects. Without international conventions or treaties, there is a legal vacuum in AI regulation. Additionally, the extraterritorial application of AI laws and regulations helps a state become a global standardsetter and gain an international sphere of influence. However, the extraterritorial application of AI laws and regulations sometimes functions as a form of legal imperialism. This exacerbates the injustice between great powers and weak countries in AI competition. To justify the legitimacy of the extraterritorial application of AI laws and regulations, it is beneficial to adopt the 'inner morality of extraterritoriality', a theoretical framework proposed by Professor Dan Svantesson. In fact, extraterritorial applicability depends on the market size and attractiveness. For other countries, whether their AI laws and regulations are endowed with extraterritorial effects is their prerogative. However, they should consider their soft power before implementing legislation.

AB  - The legislation of the European Union increasingly focuses on expanding the scope of works protected by intellectual property rights, including literary works, music, films, and phonograms. The breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI) has contributed significantly to creating works of art with little or no human intervention. The article examines the current situation of EU copyright law and Vietnamese law regarding AI-generated works. The article concludes that EU law governs copyright for these works based on the extent of human contribution to the creation of the work. Meanwhile, Vietnamese law still needs to resolve the issue of intellectual property rights for works created by AI.

AB  - It is now a clich & eacute; to highlight that whilst artificial intelligence (AI) provides many opportunities, it also presents myriad risks to established norms. Amongst the norms considered in the literature, the Rule of Law unsurprisingly features. But the analyses of the Rule of Law are narrow. AI has the capacity to augment as well as to undermine fidelity to the ideal of the Rule of Law. Rather than viewing AI only as a threat to important norms, this article's core argument is that AI should also be presented as an opportunity to meet their demands. It uses the Rule of Law in tax administration to support this argument.

AB  - How can tort law contribute to a better understanding of the risk-based approach in the European Union's (EU) Artificial Intelligence Act proposal and evolving liability regime? In a new legal area of intense development, it is pivotal to make the best use possible of existing regulation and legal knowledge. The main objective of this article is thus to investigate the relationship between traditional tort law principles, with a focus on risk assessments, and the developing legislation on artificial intelligence (AI) in the EU. The article offers a critical analysis and evaluation from a tort law perspective of the risk-based approach in the proposed AI Act and the European Parliament resolution on a civil liability regime for AI, with comparisons also to the proposal for a revised and AI-adapted product liability directive and the recently proposed directive on civil liability for AI. The discussion leads to the illumination of both challenges and possibilities in the interplay between AI, tort law and the concept of risk, displaying the large potential of tort law as a tool for handling rising AI issues.

The article argues that many initiatives contribute to increased legal certainty and can partially compensate for some of the shortcomings of the international human rights law framework, but that further clarification is badly needed. This is especially true for the responsibilities of private businesses which are developing AI and the corpus of human rights beyond privacy and data protection.

AB  - The article examines the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in law-making and law enforcement, analyzing it through the lens of the technological paradigm theory and utilizing a new methodology rooted in post-classical scientific rationality. The examination of the AI's legal personality takes into account the modern anthropocentrism standpoint, where humans are perceived as the central figure in the legal system. A human, as a subject of law, plays a crucial role in constructing legal reality. Through exercising his powers, a human transforms abstract norms into existing law. The proposal to delegate this anthropological function to AI carries significant risks that may have detrimental effects on the established system of legal regulation for public relations. The correlation between law-making and law enforcement, as integral components in establishing legal reality, pertains to the legal consciousness of individuals as subjects of law. This correlation does not necessitate the substitution of human decision- making with AI. Simultaneously, AI is capable of effectively handling auxiliary legal tasks. It possesses the necessary skills to draft regulatory acts, court decisions, and consolidate proposals obtained through law-making crowdsourcing. Additionally, it is proficient in executing automated actions, such as issuing writs of execution. The utilization of AI to implement the concept of machine- readable law and algorithmize the application of legal norms appears to hold promise. The incorporation of a digital state notion, which pertains to the transition of public service provision into digital format, is also unattainable without AI, which greatly enhances the public administration efficiency. In this case, the focal point will revolve around the matter of attaining effective control over decisions carried out by AI, as well as the prescribed boundaries of its capabilities within the legal domain, as established by legislative measures.

In this study, we used an artificial intelligence classifier to predict the decisions of Brazilian courts. Also, kindly confirm the details in the metadata are correct. To this end, we developed a text crawler to extract data from official Brazilian electronic legal systems, consisting of two datasets of cases of second-degree murder and active corruption. We applied various classifiers, such as Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, and others, to predict judicial outcomes by analyzing text features from the dataset. Our research demonstrated that Regression Trees, Gated Recurring Units, and Hierarchical Attention Networks tended to have higher metrics across our datasets. As the final goal, we searched the weights of one of the algorithms, Hierarchical Attention Networks, to find samples of the words that might be used to acquit or convict defendants based on their relevance to the algorithm.

AB  - Generative AI relies on simulating and learning from complex data distributions to automatically generate new, meaningful content from large datasets. Training generative AI models carries the risk of copyright infringement. How can we balance the development of generative AI technology with copyright protection during the training stage of these models? In contrast to existing legal scholarship, this article conducts a comparative study of industry-oriented U.S. copyright law and rights-oriented EU copyright law. It draws insights from the concepts of the tragedy of the commons and the tragedy of the anti-commons, proposing the creation of fair remuneration rights for Generative AI training under the UN's international governance regime for AI. This article offers a typological analysis of potential operational models for fair remuneration rights in Generative AI training, drawing analogies to existing remuneration rights in international copyright treaties. The goal is to provide an open framework for further discussion within the international academic community.

TI  - A House with Two Masters? Copyright Law and Originality in the Age of Artificial Intelligence
T2  - AUSTRALIAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and the implications that it has for authorship has created a crisis within copyright law. There has been much debate about whether copyright should permit AI authorship within its borders. However, the major question that needs to be addressed is really what happens after AI-authored or AI-augmented works are permitted within the boundaries of copyright law. What would be the implications for originality? Where works have been concerned, originality has long been the primary doctrinal vehicle gatekeeping entry into the copyright system. A change in the law that would permit AI-authored or AI-augmented works to sit within the system of copyright protection would call that role into question. In this article, we argue that originality will face challenges, but it will survive as a re-purposed doctrine delineating which level of protection a work may enjoy.

AB  - Machines powered by artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly taking over tasks previously performed by humans alone. In accomplishing such tasks, they may intentionally commit 'AI crimes', ie engage in behaviour which would be considered a crime if it were accomplished by humans. For instance, an advanced AI trading agent may-despite its designer's best efforts-autonomously manipulate markets while lacking the properties for being held criminally responsible. In such cases (hard AI crimes) a criminal responsibility gap emerges since no agent (human or artificial) can be legitimately punished for this outcome. We aim to shift the 'hard AI crime' discussion from blame to deterrence and design an 'AI deterrence paradigm', separate from criminal law and inspired by the economic theory of crime. The homo economicus has come to life as a machina economica, which, even if cannot be meaningfully blamed, can nevertheless be effectively deterred since it internalises criminal sanctions as costs.

KW  - international investment law
KW  - investor state arbitration adaptation
AB  - This paper proposes a structured, tiered framework through a UNCITRAL Model Law to gradually integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into foreign investment law arbitration in an ethical and effective manner. It also explores the critical role arbitration institutions can play in facilitating AI implementation. It details how AI can assist arbitrators by searching vast datasets, automating routine tasks, and enhancing decision-making through analysis of previous cases. Current AI regulations in regions like the EU, UK, and Canada fall short in addressing the complexities of cross-border arbitration and ensuring interoperability. By emphasising the distinct contributions of the proposed UNCITRAL Model Law and arbitration institutions, the paper highlights a multi-faceted strategy to overcome challenges posed by outdated international conventions, inconsistencies in bilateral investment treaties, and the lack of comprehensive guidance. This approach aims to refine the integration of AI in arbitration processes, enhancing efficiency, fairness, and the legitimacy of the arbitration system.

AB  - This article considers the benefits and pitfalls of international human rights law as a component of artificial intelligence (AI) governance initiatives. It argues that (1) human rights law can serve as an authoritative resource for providing definitions to highly contested tenns such as fairness or equality, (2) it can be used to address the problem of international regulatory arbitrage, and (3) it provides a framework to hold public and private actors legally accountable. At the same time, the paper considers recent critiques of human rights law and its application to AI governance, such as (1) lack of effectiveness; (2) inability to effect structural change, and finally, (3) the problem of cooptation. The article argues that while there is room for international human rights in the realm of AI governance, we should look to it with tempered expectations as to its promises and limitations.

AB  - The interaction between artificial intelligence (AI) and international investment treaties is an uncharted territory of international law. Concerns over the national security, safety, and privacy implications of AI are spurring regulators into action around the world. States have imposed restrictions on data transfer, utilised automated decision-making, mandated algorithmic transparency, and limited market access. This article explores the interaction between AI regulation and standards of investment protection. It is argued that the current framework provides an unpredictable legal environment in which to adjudicate the contested norms and ethics of AI. Treaties should be recalibrated to reinforce their anti-protectionist origins, embed human-centric AI principles, and embrace expert witnesses and amicus briefs.

KW  - law and psychology
AB  - It is conventionally argued that because an artificially-intelligent (AI) system acts autonomously, its makers cannot easily be held liable should the system's actions harm. Since the system cannot be liable on its own account either, existing laws expose victims to accountability gaps and need to be reformed. Recent legal instruments have nonetheless established obligations against AI developers and providers. Drawing on attribution theory, this paper examines how these seemingly opposing positions are shaped by the ways in which AI systems are conceptualised. Specifically, folk dispositionism underpins conventional legal discourse on AI liability, personality, publications, and inventions and leads us towards problematic legal outcomes. Examining the technology and terminology driving contemporary AI systems, the paper contends that AI systems are better conceptualised instead as situational characters whose actions remain constrained by their programming. Properly viewing AI systems as such illuminates how existing legal doctrines could be sensibly applied to AI and reinforces emerging calls for placing greater scrutiny on the broader AI ecosystem.

AB  - We are entering the age of artificial intelligence (AI). Once a matter of science fiction, significant developments in AI are now being regularly reported and the public is becoming more familiar with AI through applications relying on ordinary English language commands. One of the most recent applications, ChatGPT, has given people a taste of what AI may be able to accomplish. While interest in AI is rising, key questions remain about how ready intellectual property (IP) laws are for the revolution it promises to bring. Can AI invent? And even if it can create, can the creations be protected under copyright laws? Recent cases, particularly those pursued by Dr Stephen Thaler reveal a raft of problems with the interaction between AI and inventions and creations under existing IP laws, including whether AI has the legal personality necessary to qualify as an inventor or creator. The resultant category of inventions and creations may be denied any form of protection. Is this the IP system we intend or is it increasingly deficient in addressing the impact of AI, in terms of incentives and regulations around both ingestion and output? These are issues which will be explored in this article.

KW  - OUTPUT
AB  - In digital markets, concentrated Big Data and analytical algorithms enable undertakings to predict each consumer's willingness to pay with increasing accuracy and offer consumers personalized recommendations and tailored prices accordingly. In this context, concerns have arisen about whether and when AI-enabled price discrimination amounts to an abuse of dominance under competition law and would require a legal response. To address these concerns, this paper will analyze AI-enabled price discrimination from a comparative law and economics perspective. In economics, price discrimination is not always undesirable as it can increase static efficiency, and, on some occasions, it can promote dynamic efficiency and boost consumer welfare. Nevertheless, it may also lead to exclusionary and exploitative effects, especially once Tech Giants abuse their dominant positions in relevant markets. Since the protection of free competition and consumer welfare are objectives of competition law in China and the EU, competition law seems a proper instrument to step into digital markets to address these concerns. Indeed, the EU and China have established mixed regimes of competition law and other rules to tackle unfair and/or anti-competitive AI-enabled price discrimination. As such, AI-enabled price discrimination does not always require a competition law response and it requires competition authorities to make a trade-off between different considerations.

AB  - This article bridges artificial intelligence (AI) and EU private international law (PIL), also known as 'conflict of laws'. PIL is the body of (usually domestic or regional) rules that determine which country's law applies to cross-border private legal relationships, such as contracts or torts. The article will start by bringing EU PIL to bear on the application of AI in cross-border settings. To that aim, it will first evaluate whether the current framework is up to the task of determining what country's law is applicable to claims (with an emphasis on liability claims) arising out of private applications of AI systems. Then, the article will turn to discuss a recent proposal of the European Parliament for a bespoke future Regulation concerning civil liability for AI systems, including a novel rule of PIL. Finally, the enquiry will switch perspective by outlining how AI can facilitate the application of often complex rules of EU PIL in practice.

This issue is also important because of the proposition to require manufactur-ers to equip AI systems with a means to record information about the operation of the technology, in particular the type and magnitude of the risk posed by the technology and any negative effects that logging may have on the rights of others. Data gathering must be carried out in accordance with the ap-plicable laws, particularly data protection laws and trade secret protection laws. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the ap-plicable law in line with existing conflict-of-law regulations.

Claims that AI systems might displace human directors not only exaggerate AI's foreseeable technological potential, but ignore doctrinal and institutional impediments intrinsic to Delaware's competitive model - notably, heavy reliance on nuanced applications of the fiduciary duty of loyalty by a true court of equity. At the same time, however, there are discrete AI applications that might not merely be accommodated by Delaware corporate law, but perhaps eventually required. This would appear most likely in the oversight context, where loyalty has been interpreted to require good faith effort to adopt a reasonable compliance monitoring system, an approach driven by an implicit cost-benefit analysis that could lean decisively in favour of AI-based approaches in the foreseeable future.

AB  - This paper reflects my address as IAAIL president at ICAIL 2021. It is aimed to give my vision of the status of the AI and Law discipline, and possible future perspectives. In this respect, I go through different seasons of AI research (of AI and Law in particular): from the Winter of AI, namely a period of mistrust in AI (throughout the eighties until early nineties), to the Summer of AI, namely the current period of great interest in the discipline with lots of expectations. One of the results of the first decades of AI research is that "intelligence requires knowledge". Since its inception the Web proved to be an extraordinary vehicle for knowledge creation and sharing, therefore it's not a surprise if the evolution of AI has followed the evolution of the Web. I argue that a bottom-up approach, in terms of machine/deep learning and NLP to extract knowledge from raw data, combined with a top-down approach, in terms of legal knowledge representation and models for legal reasoning and argumentation, may represent a promotion for the development of the Semantic Web, as well as of AI systems. Finally, I provide my insight in the potential of AI development, which takes into account technological opportunities and theoretical limits.

LA  - English
AB  - Building upon A Manifesto In Defense of Democracy and the Rule of Law in the Age of 'Artificial Intelligence', we, the Transatlantic Reflection Group on Democracy and the Rule of Law in the Age of 'Artificial Intelligence', have reconvened to draft a second consensus manifesto that calls for the effective and legitimate enforcement of laws concerning AI systems. In doing so, we recognise the important and complementary role of standards and compliance practices. Whereas the first manifesto focused on the relationship between democratic law-making and technology, this second manifesto shifts focus from the design of law in the age of AI to the enforcement of law. Concretely, we offer 10 recommendations for addressing the key enforcement challenges shared across transatlantic stakeholders. We call on those who support these recommendations to sign this manifesto. The Fifth Edition of The Athens Roundtable on AI and the Rule of Law will take place on November 30th and December 1st, 2023. It will delve into pressing governance challenges posed by foundation models and generative AI across jurisdictions.

AB  - The article addresses the European Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act processed in the Parliament of the European Union. The regulation promotes precautions for the risks associated with AI, while favoring its development. It classifies AI systems into three categories based on the level of risk they present: unacceptable, high, and minor. Unacceptable risk AI systems, such as harmful or discriminatory are prohibited; high risk are subject to more stringent requirements; while low risk systems are not subject to any specific requirements.
   The law includes provisions to address risks associated with AI, such as security, ethical and discrimination risks. It is an important step in AI regulation in the EU and could have a significant impact on the development and use of AI with potential effects even outside the EU.

AB  - The concept of AI has always been controversial because there is no broad consensus on its definition. This is problematic from a legal perspective, as laws require precise and specific definitions, especially for concepts that have a direct impact on the scope and reach of the regulation, having this choice technological, economical and legal implications. During the European Union's AI Act legislative process, there has been a debate on the legal definition of AI, with diverging definitions of AI System being proposed by the different bodies of the European Union.

AB  - Many jurisdictions have passed very broadly drafted laws to tackle academic integrity issues, criminalising the provision or advertising of contract cheating or essay mills, such as the Skills and Post-16 Education Act 2022 in England and Wales. Recently, AI models such as chatGPT have amplified academic concerns. Here, we look at the intersection between these phenomena. We review academic cheating laws, showing that several may apply even to general-purpose AI services like chatGPT, without knowledge and intent. We identify a range of illegal adverts for AI-enhanced essay mills, and illustrate how difficult it is to draw the line between writing an essay and supporting it, such as by generating bone fide references. We also outline the consequences for intermediaries hosting these ads or providing these services, which may be significantly affected by these primarily symbolic laws. We conclude with a series of recommendations for policymakers, legislators, and education providers.

KW  - 1957
AB  - The fact that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is creating literary, artistic, and musical work raises important questions concerning copyrightability and authorship and ownership of such work under Copyright Law. A question that arises is whether AI can be considered the author and owner of work? Further, as per the Copyright Act, 1957, the author means... in relation to... work which is computer-generated, the person who causes the work to be created. Thus, who should be considered to have caused work to be created when work is created by AI? Alternatively, can it be said that no person has caused the work to be created? This paper answers these questions from the perspective of Indian Copyright Law and copyright law justifications, while briefly looking at the position in other jurisdictions such as the US and UK. It also provides possible solutions to the issue of authorship and ownership in work created by AI which include - the work entering into the public domain, compulsory licenses being sought to make use of the work, recognition of limited personhood for AI, joint authorship for the persons involved or recognizing a sui generis right in work created by AI.

AB  - Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has shed light on the restoration of fragmentary masterpieces. It is said that AI-restored content can reproduce the missing part in fragmentary works, reveal authors' initial intention, and give the younger generation a chance to appreciate the essence of cultural heritage. AI restoration leads to a discussion on whether copyright law should apply to AI-restored works. The existing literature about the nexus between the restoration of works and copyright is scarce, and none is related to AI-restored works. Therefore, this paper focuses on investigating the potential copyright issues regarding AI-restored works and exploring how the traditional copyright regime fails to solve those issues. Besides, this paper suggests recalibrating the copyright regime to enhance the authenticity of AI-restored output. Lastly, this cutting-edge article provides theoretical evidence for IP scholars interested in AI-related issues and advocates future research on the relation between AI models and copyright law.

AB  - In regulating military applications of artificial intelligence (AI), the relationship between humans and the AI systems they operate is of central importance. AI developers commonly frame the desired human-AI relationship in terms of 'trust', aiming to make AI systems sufficiently 'trustworthy' for the task at hand and foster appropriate levels of human 'trust' in complex, often inscrutable, AI systems. Meanwhile, in legal and ethical discussions, the challenge is generally framed as ensuring that humans retain 'control' over AI such that responsible operators can reliably guide the behaviour of AI systems as required by legal and other norms. Surprisingly, few have asked whether the paradigms of 'trust' and 'control' are guiding development of the human-AI relationship in the same direction. This paper outlines the nature of trust and control as they relate to regulation of the human-AI relationship and surveys some challenges which arise in regulating the military uptake of AI systems.

AB  - The potential of artificial intelligence (AI) has grown exponentially in recent years, which not only generates value but also creates risks. AI systems are characterised by their complexity, opacity and autonomy in operation. Now and in the foreseeable future, AI systems will be operating in a manner that is not fully autonomous. This signifies that providing appropriate incentives to the human parties involved is still of great importance in reducing AI-related harm. Therefore, liability rules should be adapted in such a way to provide the relevant parties with incentives to efficiently reduce the social costs of potential accidents. Relying on a law and economics approach, we address the theoretical question of what kind of liability rules should be applied to different parties along the value chain related to AI. In addition, we critically analyse the ongoing policy debates in the European Union, discussing the risk that European policymakers will fail to determine efficient liability rules with regard to different stakeholders.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is not only increasingly being used in business and administration contexts, but a race for its regulation is also underway, with the European Union (EU) spearheading the efforts. Contrary to existing literature, this article suggests that the most far-reaching and effective EU rules for AI applications in the digital economy will not be contained in the proposed AI Act, but in the Digital Markets Act (DMA). We analyse the impact of the DMA and related EU acts on AI models and underlying data across four key areas: disclosure requirements; the regulation of AI training data; access rules; and the regime for fair rankings. We demonstrate that fairness, under the DMA, goes beyond traditionally protected categories of non-discrimination law on which scholarship at the intersection of AI and law has focused on. Rather, we draw on competition law and the FRAND criteria known from intellectual property law to interpret and refine the DMA provisions on fair rankings. Moreover, we show how, based on Court of Justice of the European Union jurisprudence, a coherent interpretation of the concept of non-discrimination in both traditional non-discrimination and competition law may be found. The final section sketches out proposals for a comprehensive framework of transparency, access and fairness under the DMA and beyond.
