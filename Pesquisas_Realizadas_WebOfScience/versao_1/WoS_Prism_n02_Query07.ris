AB  - Question answering is a fundamental problem for artificial intelligence research. State-of-the-art question answering systems, such as search engines, can answer well-formed factual questions. However, they fail on nonfactual and natural language queries. On the other hand, crowdsourcing leverages human intelligence to present solutions for problems, which are hard for computers. In the process of crowdsourcing, aggregating the responses from the crowd is a big challenge of itself. This work presents a model that integrates artificial intelligence with crowdsourcing to answer difficult natural language multiple choice questions. We build a crowdsourced mobile gaming experience for "Who wants to be a millionaire?" TV quiz show to test our methods. We use lightweight artificial intelligence models in aggregating the crowd responses. Our methods are able to answer even the hardest questions with very high accuracy. The experiment results suggest that building a super player for "Who wants to be a millionaire?" is feasible using our models. This study shows that facilitating crowdsourcing with artificial intelligence is an important tool for answering questions, which trouble state-of-the-art question answering systems.

AB  - Question-answering systems are recognized as popular and frequently effective means of information seeking on the web. In such systems, information seekers can receive a concise response to their queries by presenting their questions in natural language. Interactive question answering is a recently proposed and increasingly popular solution that resides at the intersection of question answering and dialogue systems. On the one hand, the user can ask questions in normal language and locate the actual response to her inquiry; on the other hand, the system can prolong the question-answering session into a dialogue if there are multiple probable replies, very few, or ambiguities in the initial request. By permitting the user to ask more questions, interactive question answering enables users to interact with the system and receive more precise results dynamically. This survey offers a detailed overview of the interactive question-answering methods that are prevalent in current literature. It begins by explaining the foundational principles of question-answering systems, hence defining new notations and taxonomies to combine all identified works inside a unified framework. The reviewed published work on interactive question-answering systems is then presented and examined in terms of its proposed methodology, evaluation approaches, and dataset/application domain. We also describe trends surrounding specific tasks and issues raised by the community, so shedding light on the future interests of scholars. Our work is further supported by a GitHub page synthesizing all the major topics covered in this literature study. https://sisinflab.github.io/interactive-question-answering-systems-survey/

AB  - In recent years, with the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), the question answering systems for human-machine interaction based on deep learning have become a research hotspot of the IoT. Different from the structured query method in traditional Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) systems based on templates or rules, representation learning is one of the most promising approaches to solving the problems of data sparsity and semantic gaps. In this paper, an answer acquisition method for KBQA systems based on a dynamic memory network is proposed, in which representation learning is employed to represent the natural language questions that are raised by users and the knowledge base subgraphs of the related entities. These representations are taken as inputs of the dynamic memory network. The correct answers are obtained by utilizing the memory and inferential capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - The advent of large language models (LLMs) has energised research in Question-Answering (QA) tasks, enabling responses across varied domains like economics and mathematics. Despite their capabilities, LLMs often lack explainability due to their complex parameter embeddings. Additionally, integrating multimedia data into QA systems introduces challenges in processing and interpreting diverse data types such as text, images, audio, and video. This necessitates sophisticated algorithms for accurate information retrieval across media while ensuring the reliability of the data and responses remains a significant challenge. The AIQAM workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to address these challenges and enhance QA systems with multimedia data. The focus is on promoting innovations that improve the accuracy, explainability, and trustworthiness of QA systems, contributing to the development of the field.

AB  - Question answering systems (QAS) are developed to answer questions presented in natural language by extracting the answer. The development of QAS is aimed at making the Web more suited to human use by eliminating the need to sift through a lot of search results manually to determine the correct answer to a question. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to provide an overview of the current state of QAS research. It also aimed at highlighting the key limitations and gaps in the existing body of knowledge relating to QAS. Furthermore, it intended to identify the most effective methods utilized in the design of QAS. The systematic review of literature research method was selected as the most appropriate methodology for studying the research topic. This method differs from the conventional literature review as it is more comprehensive and objective. Based on the findings, QAS is a highly active area of research, with scholars taking diverse approaches in the development of their systems. Some of the limitations observed in these studies encompass the focused nature of current QAS, weaknesses associated with models that are used as building blocks for QAS, the need for standard datasets and question formats hence limiting the applicability of the QAS in practical settings, and the failure of researchers to examine their QAS solutions comprehensively. The most effective methods for designing QAS include focusing on syntax and context, utilizing word encoding and knowledge systems, leveraging deep learning, and using elements such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. Going forward, modular designs ought to be encouraged to foster collaboration in the creation of QAS.

AB  - Today, Artificial Intelligence (AI) appears as a topic widely referred to for commercial purposes, while from a technical-scientific point of view, it remains of niche interest. Unfortunately, commercial purposes often lead to confusion in defining the functionalities of human-machine interfaces (HMIs), whereas such AI tools should have to efficiently imitate or replace human beings and body parts in specific cognitive tasks. Instead, AI is often defined too vaguely, that is, not from an anthropic point of view, and therefore, it remains quite distant from the human activities it tries to imitate. Today, AI is categorized among the cognitive sciences, i.e., those sciences that call upon computational neuro-biology (particularly neural networks), mathematical logic (as a part of mathematics and philosophy), and computer science.

AB  - The multi-modal tasks have started to play a significant role in the research on artificial intelligence. A particular example of that domain is visual-linguistic tasks, such as visual question answering. The progress of modern machine learning systems is determined, among other things, by the data on which these systems are trained. Most modern visual question answering data sets contain limited type questions that can be answered either by directly accessing the image itself or by using external data. At the same time, insufficient attention is paid to the issues of social interactions between people, which limits the scope of visual question answering systems. In this paper, we propose criteria by which images suitable for social interaction visual question answering can be selected for composing such questions, based on psychological research. We believe this should serve the progress of visual question answering systems.

AB  - The authors propose methods to learn symbolic processing with deep learning and to build question answering systems by means of learned models. Symbolic processing, performed by the Prolog processing systems which execute unification, resolution, and list operations, is learned by a combination of deep learning models, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Word2Vec training. To our knowledge, the implementation of a Prolog-like processing system using deep learning is a new experiment that has not been conducted in the past. The results of their experiments revealed that the proposed methods are superior to the conventional methods because symbolic processing (1) has rich representations, (2) can interpret inputs even if they include unknown symbols, and (3) can be learned with a small amount of training data. In particular (2), handling of unknown data, which is a major task in artificial intelligence research, is solved using Word2Vec. Furthermore, question answering systems can be built from knowledge bases written in Prolog with learned symbolic processing, which, with conventional methods, is extremely difficult to accomplish. Their proposed systems can not only answer questions through powerful inferences by utilizing facts that harbor unknown data but also have the potential to build knowledge bases from a large amount of data, including unknown data, on the Web. The proposed systems are a completely new trial, there is no state-of-the-art methods in the sense of newest. Therefore, to evaluate their efficiency, they are compared with the most traditional and robust system i.e., the Prolog system. This is new research that encompasses the subjects of conventional artificial intelligence and neural network, and their systems have higher potential to build applications such as FAQ chatbots, decision support systems and energy-efficient estimation using a large amount of information on the Web. Mining hidden information through these applications will provide great value.

AB  - Commonsense reasoning has long been considered one of the holy grails of artificial intelligence. Our goal is to develop a logic-based component for hybrid - machine learning plus logic - commonsense question answering systems. A critical feature for the component is estimating the confidence in the statements derived from knowledge bases containing uncertain contrary and supporting evidence obtained from different sources. Instead of computing exact probabilities or designing a new calculus we focus on extending the methods and algorithms used by the existing automated reasoners for full classical first-order logic. The paper presents the CONFER framework and implementation for confidence estimation of derived answers.

AB  - The principle behind artificial intelligence is mimicking human intelligence in the way that it can perform tasks, recognize patterns, or predict outcomes through learning from the acquired data of various sources. Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms have been widely used in autonomous driving, recommender systems in electronic commerce and social media, fintech, natural language understanding, and question answering systems. Artificial intelligence is also gradually changing the landscape of healthcare research (Yu et al. in Biomed Eng 2:719-731, 25). The rule-based approach that relied on the curation of medical knowledge and the construction of robust decision rules had drawn significant attention in diagnosing diseases and clinical decision support since half a century ago. In recent years, machine learning algorithms such as deep learning that can account for complex interactions between features is shown to be promising in predictive modeling in healthcare (Deo in Circulation 132:1920-1930, 26). Although many of these artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms can achieve remarkably high performance, it is often difficult to be completely adopted in practical clinical environments due to the lack of explainability in some of these algorithms. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is emerging to assist in the communication of internal decisions, behavior, and actions to health care professionals. Through explaining the prediction outcomes, XAI gains the trust of the clinicians as they may learn how to apply the predictive modeling in practical situations instead of blindly following the predictions. There are still many scenarios to explore how to make XAI effective in clinical settings due to the complexity of medical knowledge.

KW  - sentiment analysis
AB  - The use of the sentiment analysis technique, which aims to extract emotions and thoughts from texts, has become a remarkable research topic today, where the importance of human-robot interaction is gradually increasing. In this study, a new hybrid sentiment analysis model is proposed using machine learning algorithms to increase emotional performance for Turkish question and answer systems. In this context, as a first, we apply text preprocessing steps to the Turkish question-answer-emotion dataset. Subsequently, we convert the preprocessed question and answer texts into text vector form using Pretrained Turkish BERT Model and two different word representation methods, TF-IDF and word2vec. Additionally, we incorporate pre-determined polarity vectors containing the positive and negative scores of words into the question-answer text vector. As a result of this study, we propose a new hybrid sentiment analysis model. We separate vectorized and expanded question-answer text vectors into training and testing data and train and test them with machine learning algorithms. By employing this previously unused method in Turkish question-answering systems, we achieve an accuracy value of up to 91.05% in sentiment analysis. Consequently, this study contributes to making human-robot interactions in Turkish more realistic and sensitive.

A crucial aspect is knowledge-based question answering (KBQA), used in search engines and intelligent customer service to enhance user experiences. However, existing methods often struggle to model complex relationships and operations in few-shot learning environments. To solve this problem, a multi-task KBQA method has been proposed. This method includes various auxiliary tasks such as relational sequence prediction, knowledge completion prediction, and query program reconstruction. A multi-task fusion training approach was adopted for model generation. Experimental results show that accuracy can be significantly improved by more than 6% in few-shot learning environments, achieving better performance with an accuracy rate of 92.45%.

AB  - The prediction of chemical synthesis pathways plays a pivotal role in materials science research. Challenges, such as the complexity of synthesis pathways and the lack of comprehensive datasets, currently hinder our ability to predict these chemical processes accurately. However, recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GAI), including automated text generation and question-answering systems, coupled with fine-tuning techniques, have facilitated the deployment of large-scale AI models tailored to specific domains. In this study, we harness the power of the LLaMA2-7B model and enhance it through a learning process that incorporates 13878 pieces of structured material knowledge data. This specialized AI model, named MatChat, focuses on predicting inorganic material synthesis pathways. MatChat exhibits remarkable proficiency in generating and reasoning with knowledge in materials science. Although MatChat requires further refinement to meet the diverse material design needs, this research undeniably highlights its impressive reasoning capabilities and innovative potential in materials science. MatChat is now accessible online and open for use, with both the model and its application framework available as open source. This study establishes a robust foundation for collaborative innovation in the integration of generative AI in materials science.

AB  - Making use of knowledge bases to answer questions (KBQA) is a key direction in question answering systems. Researchers have developed a diverse range of methods to address this problem, but there are still some limitations with the existing methods. Specifically, the existing neural network-based methods for KBQA have not taken advantage of the recent "matching-aggregation" framework for the sequence matching, and when representing a candidate answer entity, they may not choose the most useful context of the candidate for matching. In this paper, we explore the use of a "matching-aggregation" framework to match candidate answers with questions. We further make use of question-specific contextual relations to enhance the representations of candidate answer entities. Our complete method is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets: WebQuestions and SimpleQuestions.

AB  - Currently, an increasing number of governments have adopted question answering systems (QASs) in public service delivery. As some citizens with limited information literacy often express their questions vaguely when interacting with a chatbot, it is necessary to improve the contextual understanding and reasoning ability of government chatbots (G-chatbots). This goal can be achieved through the optimisation of the matching between question, answer and context. By incorporating the Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs) and fuzzy logic, this study proposes a multi-turn dialogue model that introduces a re-question mechanism and a subgraph matching algorithm. The experiment results show that the model can improve the contextual reasoning ability of G-chatbots by about 10% and generate answers in a more explainable way. This study innovatively integrates a question-answer-context matching approach, re-question mechanism into the MTRF-G-chatbot model, reducing barriers to citizens' access to government services and enhancing contextual reasoning abilities.

AB  - Conversational AI is one of the most active research areas in AI, and it has gained more attention from academia as well as industry. Given recent advancements in several conversational AI systems in addition to the availability of several datasets, the aim of this study is to explore the landscape of Arabic text-based conversational AI systems. In this work, we provide a thorough review of recent Arabic conversational AI systems. We group them into three categories based on their functionality: (1) question-answering (QA) systems, (2) task-oriented dialogue systems (DS), and (3) chatbots. Furthermore, we describe the common datasets used in building and evaluating conversational AI systems in Arabic. Few surveys have targeted the conversational AI field for the Arabic language, and we aim to cover this gap with this study. Our contribution focuses on reviewing and analyzing the literature in the field and highlighting future research directions towards human-like conversational AI systems in Arabic.

TI  - Building machine reading comprehension model from scratch

AB  - In this paper, we introduce a machine reading comprehension model and how we built this model from scratch. Reading comprehension is a crucial requisite for artificial intelligence applications, such as Question-Answering systems, chatbots, virtual assistants etc. Reading comprehension task requires the highest complexity of natural language processing methods. In recent years, the transformer neural architecture could achieve the ability to solve high complexity tasks. To make these applications available in Hungarian as well it is inevitable to design a Hungarian corpus of reading comprehension so that the pretrained models can be fine-tuned on this dataset.
   In our research, we have created the HuRC (Hungarian Reading Comprehension) corpus, which is the first dataset in Hungarian aiming to train, test and evaluate language models on a reading comprehension task. We built such a dataset based on the English ReCoRD corpus. This is a dataset of 120,000 examples consisting of news articles containing a passage and a close-style query, where a named entity is masked and the reference answer has to be found in a list.
   Using the evaluated dataset and transformers' question-answering library, we have built the first neural machine reading comprehension models in commonsense reasoning task for Hungarian.

AB  - This manuscript delves into the augmentation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) through Knowledge Graphs (KG), aimed at elevating the performance of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Despite the remarkable strides made by Large Language Models (LLMs) in the domain of language comprehension and generation, challenges persist in handling tasks requiring granular or specialized domain knowledge. To address this issue, researchers have proposed the RAG system, which enhances task performance and interpretability by amalgamating retrieval modules with LLMs. However, current RAG systems still face deficiencies in managing retrieval noise and hallucination issues. The article proposes a novel dual-pathway approach, integrating structured Knowledge Graph data into the retrieval module of RAG, to refine retrieval quality and yield more accurate and coherent outputs. Experimental validation demonstrates the efficacy of this approach in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generated content, particularly in controlling hallucinations and bolstering the output's reliability when processing lengthy text inputs. Moreover, this methodology offers significant flexibility and customizability, facilitating adjustments in retrieval patterns and output formats according to the diverse requirements of different tasks, heralding widespread applicability in artificial intelligence-powered question-answering systems and text comprehension tasks.

AB  - The amazing research of Artificial Intelligence is natural language processing (NLP) and the mesmerizing field in NLP is machine reading comprehension (MRC). MRC alleviates the efforts of making machines behave like a human as it helps information accessing in natural language by developing Question answering systems. MRC is summarized as a task to read a piece of text, understand it, and answer the related question of the text. Reading text can be cloze style reading (fill in the blanks from the text) as well as open style reading (separate question) and understanding the piece of text as well as the query is accomplished by contextual representation and Attention mechanism. In the MRC literature, various methodologies have been used for extracting answers from the given text including primitive methods to the deep learning methods to have a step towards deploying machine intelligence. The introduction of deep learning and large datasets in the recent few years has encouraged the success of MRC. This paper gives a recent review of MRC models based on deep learning, datasets on which they have been evaluated, and also their word representations.

AB  - Open Domain Question Answering (ODQA) within natural language processing involves building systems that answer factual questions using large-scale knowledge corpora. Recent advances stem from the confluence of several factors, such as large-scale training datasets, deep learning techniques, and the rise of large language models. High-quality datasets are used to train models on realistic scenarios and enable the evaluation of the system on potentially unseen data. Standardized metrics facilitate comparisons between different ODQA systems, allowing researchers to objectively track advancements in the field. Our study presents a thorough examination of the current landscape of ODQA benchmarking by reviewing 52 datasets and 20 evaluation techniques across textual and multimodal modalities. We introduce a novel taxonomy for ODQA datasets that incorporates both the modality and difficulty of the question types. Additionally, we present a structured organization of ODQA evaluation metrics along with a critical analysis of their inherent trade-offs. Our study aims to empower researchers by providing a framework for the robust evaluation of modern question-answering systems. We conclude by identifying the current challenges and outlining promising avenues for future research and development.

AB  - Question generation is an important yet challenging problem in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which aims to generate natural and relevant questions from various input formats, e.g., natural language text, structure database, knowledge base, and image. In this article, we focus on question generation from natural language text, which has received tremendous interest in recent years due to the widespread applications such as data augmentation for question answering systems. During the past decades, many different question generation models have been proposed, from traditional rule-based methods to advanced neural network-based methods. Since there have been a large variety of research works proposed, we believe it is the right time to summarize the current status, learn from existing methodologies, and gain some insights for future development. In contrast to existing reviews, in this survey, we try to provide a more comprehensive taxonomy of question generation tasks from three different perspectives, i.e., the types of the input context text, the target answer, and the generated question. We take a deep look into existing models from different dimensions to analyze their underlying ideas, major design principles, and training strategies We compare these models through benchmark tasks to obtain an empirical understanding of the existing techniques. Moreover, we discuss what is missing in the current literature and what are the promising and desired future directions.

AB  - The National Judicial Examination of China is an essential examination for selecting legal practitioners. In recent years, people have tried to use machine learning algorithms to answer examination questions. With the proposal of JEC-QA (Zhong et al. 2020), the judicial examination becomes a particular legal task. The data of judicial examination contains two types, i.e., Knowledge-Driven questions and Case-Analysis questions. Both require complex reasoning and text comprehension, thus challenging computers to answer judicial examination questions. We propose B ilinear C onvolutional Neural Networks and A ttention Networks ( BCA ) in this paper, which is an improved version based on the model proposed by our team on the Challenge of AI in Law 2021 judicial examination task. It has two essential modules, K nowledge- D riven M odule ( KDM ) for local features extraction and C ase- A nalysis M odule ( CAM ) for the semantic difference clarification between the question stem and the options. We also add a post-processing module to correct the results in the final stage. The experimental results show that our system achieves state -of -the -art in the offline test of the judicial examination task.

AB  - In the field of electricity, specialized terminology is often intricate and complex, making it challenging for non-experts to comprehend. However, with the advancement of artificial intelligence technology, the emergence of large language models provides a new technological solution to address this issue. Large language models, based on deep learning techniques, have the capability to quickly understand and interpret specialized terminology in the electricity domain through learning from a vast corpus of professional literature and data. They can then be applied to various domains, including question-answering systems. However, existing large language models still face issues of unreliable outputs, necessitating a method to evaluate their results and improve the quality of their applications. We propose a knowledge graph-based credibility evaluation method for electric grid large language model knowledge question-answering. This method aligns the answers generated by large language models with the knowledge graph of a local knowledge base and calculates their cosine similarity and Pearson correlation coefficient. We batch-process the answers from the large language model into an electricity dataset and validate them using this method. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can accurately and efficiently reflect the relevance between texts, providing a reliable scoring basis for question-answering by large models in vertical domains. Future research can focus on exploring other embedding methods that can better extract semantic relationships between texts and validating the feasibility of this method in vertical domains other than electricity.

AB  - Legal question answering is one of the critical topics in the field of legal intelligence, and the judicial examination is a multi-choice question-answering task. However, previous scoring-based methods for the multi-choice task suffer from the classification bias problem and can not fully exploit the relationship between reference books, questions, and multi-choice answers. To address the issues, in this paper, we propose a BERT and attention based model for the judicial examination task. Specifically, we first use the BM25 algorithm to retrieve articles in the reference law books to provide certain information to answer a given question. Second, we input a question, its multi-choice answers, and the retrieved relevant articles to BERT for encoding. Third, we input the encoded information to the module of information fuse and match through attention mechanism to find deep relationships in articles, questions, and multi-choice answers. Finally, we concatenate the output of the attention mechanism and input it to a binary classifier to determine whether an answer option to the question is correct. We have done extensive experiments to show that our model significantly outperforms the baselines in accuracy. We also experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of some components of our model. Moreover, we applied our method in the Challenge of AI in Law 2022 (CAIL 2022) and won the third prize in the judicial examination task in this competition.

AB  - The task of abstractive text summarization aims to automatically generate a short and concise summary of a given source article. In recent years, automatic abstractive text summarization has attracted the attention of researchers because large volumes of digital text are readily available in multiple languages on a wide range of topics. Automatically generating precise summaries from large text has potential application in the generation of news headlines, a summary of research articles, the moral of the stories, media marketing, search engine optimization, financial research, social media marketing, question-answering systems, and chatbots. In literature, the problem of abstractive text summarization has been mainly investigated for English and some other languages. However, it has not been thoroughly explored for the Urdu language despite having a huge amount of data available in digital format. To fulfill this gap, this paper presents a large benchmark corpus of 2,067,784 Urdu news articles for the Urdu abstractive text summarization task. As a secondary contribution, we applied a range of deep learning (LSTM, Bi-LSTM, LSTM with attention, GRU, Bi-GRU, and GRU with attention), and large language models (BART and GPT-3.5) on our proposed corpus. Our extensive evaluation on 20,000 test instances showed that GRU with attention model outperforms the other models with ROUGE- 1 = 46.7 , ROUGE- 2 = 24.1 , and ROUGE-L = 48.7. To foster research in Urdu, our proposed corpus is publically and freely available for research purposes under the Creative Common Licence.

AB  - With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), question answering systems have become common for users to interact with computers, e.g., ChatGPT and Siri. These systems require a substantial amount of labeled data to train their models. However, the labeled data is scarce and challenging to be constructed. The construction process typically involves two stages: discovering potential sample candidates and manually labeling these candidates. To discover high-quality candidate samples, we study the intention paraphrase template discovery task: Given some seed questions or templates of an intention, discover new paraphrase templates that describe the intention and are diverse to the seeds enough in text. As the first exploration of the task, we identify the new quality requirements, i.e., relevance, divergence and popularity, and identify the new challenges, i.e., the paradox of divergent yet relevant paraphrases, and the conflict of popular yet relevant paraphrases. To untangle the paradox of divergent yet relevant paraphrases, in which the traditional bag of words falls short, we develop usage-centric modeling, which represents a question/template/answer as a bag of usages that users engaged (e.g., up-votes), and uses a usage-flow graph to interrelate templates, questions and answers. To balance the conflict of popular yet relevant paraphrases, we propose a new and principled decomposition for the well-known Pointwise Mutual Information from the usage perspective (usage-PMI), and then develop a Bayesian inference framework over the usage-flow graph to estimate the usage-PMI. Extensive experiments over three large CQA corpora show strong performance advantage over the baselines adopted from paraphrase identification task. We release 885, 000 paraphrase templates of high quality discovered by our proposed PMI decomposition model, and the data is available in site https://github.com/Para-Questions/Intention_template_discovery.

AB  - Objectives Question answering (QA) systems have the potential to improve the quality of clinical care by providing health professionals with the latest and most relevant evidence. However, QA systems have not been widely adopted. This systematic review aims to characterize current medical QA systems, assess their suitability for healthcare, and identify areas of improvement.Materials and methods We searched PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, ACL Anthology, and forward and backward citations on February 7, 2023. We included peer-reviewed journal and conference papers describing the design and evaluation of biomedical QA systems. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. We conducted a narrative synthesis and risk of bias assessment for each study. We assessed the utility of biomedical QA systems.Results We included 79 studies and identified themes, including question realism, answer reliability, answer utility, clinical specialism, systems, usability, and evaluation methods. Clinicians' questions used to train and evaluate QA systems were restricted to certain sources, types and complexity levels. No system communicated confidence levels in the answers or sources. Many studies suffered from high risks of bias and applicability concerns. Only 8 studies completely satisfied any criterion for clinical utility, and only 7 reported user evaluations. Most systems were built with limited input from clinicians.Discussion While machine learning methods have led to increased accuracy, most studies imperfectly reflected real-world healthcare information needs. Key research priorities include developing more realistic healthcare QA datasets and considering the reliability of answer sources, rather than merely focusing on accuracy.

AB  - Developing Question Answering systems (QA) is one of the main goals in Artificial Intelligence. With the advent of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, QA systems have witnessed significant advances. Although DL performs very well on QA, it requires a considerable amount of annotated data for training. Many annotated datasets have been built for the QA task; most of them are exclusively in English. In order to address the need for a high-quality QA dataset in the Persian language, we present PersianQuAD, the native QA dataset for the Persian language. We create PersianQuAD in four steps: 1) Wikipedia article selection, 2) question-answer collection, 3) three-candidates test set preparation, and 4) Data Quality Monitoring. PersianQuAD consists of approximately 20,000 questions and answers made by native annotators on a set of Persian Wikipedia articles. The answer to each question is a segment of the corresponding article text. To better understand PersianQuAD and ensure its representativeness, we analyze PersianQuAD and show it contains questions of varying types and difficulties. We also present three versions of a deep learning-based QA system trained with PersianQuAD. Our best system achieves an F1 score of 82.97% which is comparable to that of QA systems on English SQuAD, made by the Stanford University. This shows that PersianQuAD performs well for training deep-learning-based QA systems. Human performance on PersianQuAD is significantly better (96.49%), demonstrating that PersianQuAD is challenging enough and there is still plenty of room for future improvement. PersianQuAD and all QA models implemented in this paper are freely available.

AB  - Artificial intelligence-based question-answering (QA) systems can expedite the performance of various tasks. These systems either read passages and answer questions given in natural languages or if a question is given, they extract the most accurate answer from documents retrieved from the internet. Arabic is spoken by Arabs and Muslims and is located in the middle of the Arab world, which encompasses the Middle East and North Africa. It is difficult to use natural language processing techniques to process modern Arabic owing to the language's complex morphology, orthographic ambiguity, regional variations in spoken Arabic, and limited linguistic and technological resources. Only a few Arabic QA experiments and systems have been designed on small datasets, some of which are yet to be made available. Although several reviews of Arabic QA studies have been conducted, the number of studies covered has been limited and recent trends have not been included. To the best of our knowledge, only two systematic reviews focused on Arabic QA have been published to date. One covered only 26 primary studies without considering recent techniques, while the other covered only nine studies conducted for Holy Qur'an QA systems. Here, the included studies were analyzed in terms of the datasets used, domains covered, types of Arabic questions asked, information retrieved, the mechanism used to extract answers, and the techniques used. Based on the results of the analysis, several limitations, concerns, and recommendations for future research were identified. Additionally, a novel taxonomy was developed to categorize the techniques used based on the domains and approaches of the QA system.

AB  - With the continuous reform of education informatization, modern information technology gradually became a key technology in education. An intelligent question-answering system was constructed in this research for knowledge management services. It included an entity recognition model based on bidirectional long short-term memory attention conditional random field and a question classification model based on a bidirectional encoder using Transformers text convolutional neural network. The entity recognition model added a reverse long short-term memory propagation structure, while introducing an attention mechanism and conditional random field model. The question classification model utilized a preprocessed structure to output a feature matrix with richer semantic information, while utilizing a bidirectional encoder to extract local features of short text sentences. These experiments confirmed that the constructed model had a high precision of 0.945, which was much higher than other models. The recall of this proposed model was 0.077 higher than the control models. For precision, the proposed model had good recognition performance for methods, files and modules, with values of 0.9040, 0.9050 and 0.9160, respectively. For the recall, the question classification model had the best recognition effect on files, at 0.9060. For the F1-score, the proposed model had the best recognition performance for modules, at 0.9100. The named entity recognition model constructed had high accuracy and F1-score, reaching 0.931 and 0.923, indicating that it had the best classification performance in the dataset. Through intelligent question-answering systems, automatic answering of questions can be achieved, effectively improving knowledge services. This research has integrated knowledge and technology from multiple disciplines such as computer science, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing to promote the cross-integration of these disciplines in knowledge management. This interdisciplinary method not only broadens the research perspective of knowledge management but also provides new ideas and methods for the development of related fields.

AB  - Introduction . The development of artificial intelligence methods and technologies aimed at speech recognition contributes to the creation of specialised programmes - namely voice assistants - which are capable of conducting a dialogue in natural language. Such services are of particular relevance in inclusive education in order to support students with visual impairments. The research problem lies in the individualised support of students' independent work based on a voice assistant and is determined by the contradiction between the widespread use of various question -answer systems in business and everyday life (including those with a voice interface), on the one hand, and insufficient knowledge their didactic possibilities, on the other hand. Aim. The present research aims to investigate and practically implement the methodology of inclu - sive design of digital educational resources on the example of creating an intelligent voice assistant for students' independent work in the course "Computer Networks". Methodology and research methods . The current research is based on the methodology of inclusive design in combination with an ontological approach in relation to the creation of digital educational resources, speech recognition methods, methods for designing intelligent systems and knowledge bases, methods and technologies for designing and implementing automated learning systems with feedback. To recognise questions, search for answers, and support dialogues carried out by a voice assistant, the authors applied natural language text analysis methods and classification models created using machine learning methods. Results. The authors have developed and substantiated the requirements that a digital educational resource must meet in accordance with the principles of inclusive design, linking an ontological approach to content development, automatic individualised support for students, and monitoring the achievement of educational results. According to the formulated requirements, the authors have developed an inter - active computer service - an intelligent voice assistant that provides support for students' independent work when performing practical tasks, using the "Computer Networks" course as an example. The service supports voice input and subsequent interpretation of questions, search for answers in the knowledge base with voice output of the result, and implements the execution of operations according to certain rules. Scientific novelty. The authors have clarified the content of the concept of "inclusive design" in the context of digital educational resources, when the key feature is the focus on continuous improvement of the didactic capabilities of a particular product. The authors have shown that this can be achieved through a conceptually based content structure and initially provided feedback. This approach has prov - en to be effective in designing an intelligent voice assistant to answer student questions and to automat - ically perform operations on a computer. Practical significance. The use of a voice assistant by students of the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Tyumen in the process of studying the course "Computer Net - works" demonstrated the relevance of developing similar question -answering systems to accompany the independent work of students, including those with visual impairments in online and blended learning. The developed service is universal and can be used with any knowledge base that provides answers to students' questions.
