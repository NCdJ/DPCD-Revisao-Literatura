AB  - Legal Tech is developed to help people with legal services and solve legal problems via machines. To achieve this, one of the key requirements for machines is to utilize legal knowledge and comprehend legal context. This can be fulfilled by natural language processing (NLP) techniques, for instance, text representation, text categorization, question answering (QA) and natural language inference, etc. To this end, we introduce a freely available Chinese Legal Tech system (IFlyLegal) that benefits from multiple NLP tasks. It is an integrated system that performs legal consulting, multiway law searching, and legal document analysis by exploiting techniques such as deep contextual representations and various attention mechanisms. To our knowledge, IFlyLegal is the first Chinese legal system that employs upto-date NLP techniques and caters for needs of different user groups, such as lawyers, judges, procurators, and clients. Since Jan, 2019, we have gathered 2,349 users and 28,238 page views (till June, 23, 2019).

This dataset does not contain any labels related to the prior court case retrieval task. Masked language modeling is used to train BERTurk-Legal in a self-supervised manner. With zero-shot classification, BERTurk-Legal provides state-of-the-art results on the dataset consisting of legal cases of the Court of Cassation of Turkey. The results of the experiments show the necessity of developing language models specific to the Turkish law domain.

AB  - Legal text is significantly different from English text (e.g. Wikipedia, News) used for training most natural language processing (NLP) algorithms. As a result, the state of the art algorithms (e.g. GPT3, BERT derivatives), need additional effort (e.g. fine-tuning and further pre-training) to achieve optimal performance on legal text. Hence there is a need to create separate NLP data sets and benchmarks for legal text which are challenging and focus on tasks specific to legal systems. This will spur innovation in applications of NLP for legal text and will benefit AI community and legal fraternity. This paper focuses on an empirical review of the existing work in the use of NLP in Indian legal text and proposes ideas to create new benchmarks for Indian Legal NLP.

AB  - A significant challenge in the legal domain is to organize and summarize a constantly growing collection of legal documents, uncovering hidden topics, or themes, that later can support tasks such as legal case retrieval and legal judgment prediction. This massive amount of digital legal documents, combined with the inherent complexity of judiciary systems worldwide, presents a promising scenario for Machine Learning solutions, mainly those taking advantage of all the advancements in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is in this scenario that Jusbrasil, the largest legal tech company in Brazil, is situated. Using a dataset partially curated by the Jusbrasil legal team, we explore topic modeling solutions using state of the art language models, trained with legal Portuguese documents, to automatically organize and summarize this complex collection of documents. Instead of using an entire legal case, which usually is composed of many pages, we show that it is possible to efficiently organize the collection using the syllabus (in Portuguese, ementa jurisprudencial) from each court decision as they concisely summarize the main points presented by the entire decision.

AB  - This paper reviews the most recent literature on experiments with different Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques applied to predict judicial and administrative decisions. Among the most outstanding findings, we have that the most used data mining techniques are Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) and Random Forest (RF), and in terms of the most used deep learning techniques, we found Long-Term Memory (LSTM) and transformers such as BERT. An important finding in the papers reviewed was that the use of machine learning techniques has prevailed over those of deep learning. Regarding the place of origin of the research carried out, we found that 64% of the works belong to studies carried out in English-speaking countries, 8% in Portuguese and 28% in other languages (such as German, Chinese, Turkish, Spanish, etc.). Very few works of this type have been carried out in Spanish-speaking countries. The classification criteria of the works have been based, on the one hand, on the identification of the classifiers used to predict situations (or events with legal interference) or judicial decisions and, on the other hand, on the application of classifiers to the phenomena regulated by the different branches of law: criminal, constitutional, human rights, administrative, intellectual property, family law, tax law and others. The corpus size analyzed in the reviewed works reached 100,000 documents in 2020. Finally, another important finding lies in the accuracy of these predictive techniques, reaching predictions of over 60% in different branches of law.

AB  - Legal-BERT models are based on the BERT architecture (or its variants) and have been developed specifically for the legal domain. They have reached the state of the art in complex legal tasks such as legal research, document synthesis, contract analysis, argument extraction, and legal prediction. In this paper, we proposed four versions of Legal-BERT models pre-trained on the Italian legal domain. They aim to improve NLP applications in the Italian legal context. We have shown that they outperforms the Italian "generalpurpose" BERT in several domain-specific tasks, such as named entity recognition, sentence classification, semantic similarity with Bi-encoders, and document classification.

CP  - Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL-EMNLP)
AB  - BERT has achieved impressive performance in several NLP tasks. However, there has been limited investigation on its adaptation guidelines in specialised domains. Here we focus on the legal domain, where we explore several approaches for applying BERT models to downstream legal tasks, evaluating on multiple datasets. Our findings indicate that the previous guidelines for pre-training and fine-tuning, often blindly followed, do not always generalize well in the legal domain. Thus we propose a systematic investigation of the available strategies when applying BERT in specialised domains. These are: (a) use the original BERT out of the box, (b) adapt BERT by additional pre-training on domain-specific corpora, and (c) pre-train BERT from scratch on domain-specific corpora. We also propose a broader hyper-parameter search space when fine-tuning for downstream tasks and we release LEGAL- BERT, a family of BERT models intended to assist legal NLP research, computational law, and legal technology applications.

AB  - Complex legal language, filled with jargon, nuanced language semantics, and a high level of domain specificity, poses a significant challenge for automation in handling various legal tasks. In the realm of legal document composition, a pivotal component revolves around accurately referencing case laws and other sources to substantiate assertions and arguments. Understanding the legal domain and identifying appropriate citation context or cite-worthy sentences automatically is challenging. Our research is centered on the issue of citation-worthiness identification of a given sentence. This serves as the initial phase in contemporary citation recommendation systems, aimed at alleviating the effort involved in extracting a suitable array of citation contexts. To address this, we first introduce a labeled dataset comprising 178 million sentences, specifically tailored for detecting citation-worthy content within the legal domain. This dataset is curated from the Caselaw Access Project (CAP)(2) (https://case.law/). We proceeded to assess the performance of a range of deep learning models on this novel dataset. Among the models examined, the domain-specific pre-trained model consistently demonstrated superior performance, achieving an 88% F1-score in the task of detecting citation-worthy material. To enhance our insights, we employed inputXGradient explainable AI techniques to dissect the predictions, thereby identifying the tokens that contribute to specific citation classes.

AB  - Perhaps the most widely touted of GPT-4's at-launch, zero-shot capabilities has been its reported 90th-percentile performance on the Uniform Bar Exam. This paper begins by investigating the methodological challenges in documenting and verifying the 90th-percentile claim, presenting four sets of findings that indicate that OpenAI's estimates of GPT-4's UBE percentile are overinflated. First, although GPT-4's UBE score nears the 90th percentile when examining approximate conversions from February administrations of the Illinois Bar Exam, these estimates are heavily skewed towards repeat test-takers who failed the July administration and score significantly lower than the general test-taking population. Second, data from a recent July administration of the same exam suggests GPT-4's overall UBE percentile was below the 69th percentile, and similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 48th percentile on essays. Third, examining official NCBE data and using several conservative statistical assumptions, GPT-4's performance against first-time test takers is estimated to be similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 62nd percentile, including similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 42nd percentile on essays. Fourth, when examining only those who passed the exam (i.e. licensed or license-pending attorneys), GPT-4's performance is estimated to drop to similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 48th percentile overall, and similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 15th percentile on essays. In addition to investigating the validity of the percentile claim, the paper also investigates the validity of GPT-4's reported scaled UBE score of 298. The paper successfully replicates the MBE score, but highlights several methodological issues in the grading of the MPT + MEE components of the exam, which call into question the validity of the reported essay score. Finally, the paper investigates the effect of different hyperparameter combinations on GPT-4's MBE performance, finding no significant effect of adjusting temperature settings, and a significant effect of few-shot chain-of-thought prompting over basic zero-shot prompting. Taken together, these findings carry timely insights for the desirability and feasibility of outsourcing legally relevant tasks to AI models, as well as for the importance for AI developers to implement rigorous and transparent capabilities evaluations to help secure safe and trustworthy AI.
