The variety of exceptional measures adopted in countries characterized by different legal systems and natural languages, as well as the rapid evolution of such measures, pose considerable challenges to manual textual analysis methods traditionally used in the social sciences. To address these challenges, we develop a supervised classifier to support the manual coding of exceptional policies by a multinational team of human coders. After presenting the results of various natural language processing (NLP) experiments, we show that human-in-the-loop approaches to computational text analysis outperform unsupervised approaches in accurately extracting policy events from legal texts. We draw lessons from our experience to ensure the successful integration of NLP methods into social science research agendas.","2024-07","2024-10-27 16:07:34","2024-10-27 16:07:34","","704-723","","3","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001079523000001","","","","","","","computational text analysis; COVID-19; crisis governance; EMERGENCY; law-as-data; natural language processing; SCIENCE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we present a dataset of 2944 legal references in German law that are manually annotated by law experts. This dataset has 21 properties for each law reference in the dataset, such as Buch, Teil, Titel, Untertitel, etc. It also provides the complete text of each law reference in the dataset, along with specific paragraph text mentioned in the law reference. Furthermore, using this dataset together with Open Legal Data, we perform a law reference prediction task to compare the performance between predicting full law reference and only the base law reference.","2023","2024-10-27 16:07:34","2024-10-27 16:07:34","","392-396","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001139079400042","","","","","","","NLP; Law Reference Annotations; Law References; Legal Language Processing; Open Legal Data; Sentence Transformers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PROCEEDINGS OF THE 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW, ICAIL 2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We consider a variety of approaches, including dynamic few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and zero-shot prompting. While we achieve results with GPT-3 that are better than the previous best published results, we also identify several types of clear errors it makes. We investigate why these errors happen. We discover that GPT-3 has imperfect prior knowledge of the actual U.S. statutes on which SARA is based.

The article deploys a form of computational natural language processing, using a large-language model machine learning process (GPT-3) to extract data from online Federal Court dockets. The article reviews patterns in outcomes in thousands of stay of removal applications identified through this process and reveals a wide range in stay grant rates across many justices. The article argues that the Federal Court should take measures to encourage more consistency in stay decision-making and cautions against relying heavily on stays of removal to ensure that deportation complies with constitutional procedural justice protections. The article is also a demonstration of how machine learning can be used to pursue empirical legal research projects that would have been cost prohibitive or technically challenging only a few years ago-and shows how technology that is increasingly used to enhance the power of the state at the expense of marginalized migrants can instead be used to scrutinize legal decision-making in the immigration law field, hopefully in ways that enhance the rights of migrants.

While data or information are not subject matter within copyright law, almost all materials used to construct corpora for machine learning are protected by copyright law: texts, images, videos, and so on. There are global policy moves to address the copyright implications of machine learning, in particular in the context of so-called ""foundation models"" that underpin generative AI. This paper takes a step back, exploring empirically three technological settings through detailed case studies. We set out the established industry methodology of a lifecycle of AI (collecting data, organising data, model training, model operation) to arrive at descriptions suitable for legal analysis. This will allow an assessment of the challenges for a harmonisation of rights, exceptions and disclosure under EU copyright law. The three case studies are:Machine learning for scientific purposes, in the context of a study of regional short-term letting markets;Natural Language Processing (NLP), in the context of large language models;Computer vision, in the context of content moderation of images.We find that the nature and quality of data corpora at the input stage is central to the lifecycle of machine learning. Because of the uncertain legal status of data collection and processing, combined with the competitive advantage gained by firms not disclosing technological advances, the inputs of the models deployed are often unknown. Moreover, the ""lawful access"" requirement of the EU exception for text and data mining may turn the exception into a decision by rightholders to allow machine learning in the context of their decision to allow access. We assess policy interventions at EU level, seeking to clarify the legal status of input data via copyright exceptions, opt-outs or the forced disclosure of copyright materials. We find that the likely result is a fully copyright-licensed environment of machine learning that may have problematic effects for the structure of industry, innovation and scientific research.","2024-01","2024-10-27 16:07:35","2024-10-27 16:07:35","","110-138","","1","55","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001155789200001","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Copyright; Data mining; Digital single market; EU; TEXT; Text mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has the potential to form the basis for further transformation of the national model of justice.

This paper begins by investigating the methodological challenges in documenting and verifying the 90th-percentile claim, presenting four sets of findings that indicate that OpenAI's estimates of GPT-4's UBE percentile are overinflated. First, although GPT-4's UBE score nears the 90th percentile when examining approximate conversions from February administrations of the Illinois Bar Exam, these estimates are heavily skewed towards repeat test-takers who failed the July administration and score significantly lower than the general test-taking population. Second, data from a recent July administration of the same exam suggests GPT-4's overall UBE percentile was below the 69th percentile, and similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 48th percentile on essays. Third, examining official NCBE data and using several conservative statistical assumptions, GPT-4's performance against first-time test takers is estimated to be similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 62nd percentile, including similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 42nd percentile on essays. Fourth, when examining only those who passed the exam (i.e. licensed or license-pending attorneys), GPT-4's performance is estimated to drop to similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 48th percentile overall, and similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 15th percentile on essays. In addition to investigating the validity of the percentile claim, the paper also investigates the validity of GPT-4's reported scaled UBE score of 298. The paper successfully replicates the MBE score, but highlights several methodological issues in the grading of the MPT + MEE components of the exam, which call into question the validity of the reported essay score. Finally, the paper investigates the effect of different hyperparameter combinations on GPT-4's MBE performance, finding no significant effect of adjusting temperature settings, and a significant effect of few-shot chain-of-thought prompting over basic zero-shot prompting. Taken together, these findings carry timely insights for the desirability and feasibility of outsourcing legally relevant tasks to AI models, as well as for the importance for AI developers to implement rigorous and transparent capabilities evaluations to help secure safe and trustworthy AI.","2024-03-30","2024-10-27 16:07:35","2024-10-27 16:07:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001194581100001","","","","","","","NLP; Machine learning; Natural language processing; LAW; Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence and law; Law and technology; Legal analytics; Legal NLP; Legal profession","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By automating complex decisions and processing extensive datasets, AI promises to enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of trade and dispute resolution. This research delves into AI's potential applications within the WTO, highlighting how predictive analytics and decision support systems could transform trade dispute resolutions. However, the integration of AI also presents challenges, including ethical concerns, the need for transparency, and data privacy issues. Balancing these challenges with the benefits of AI is crucial to maintaining fairness and accuracy in legal processes. This paper advocates for international collaboration to establish standards guiding AI applications in international trade and dispute resolution, ensuring that technological advancements support the WTO's goals without compromising the integrity of the legal system. A new legal framework is essential to harness the full potential of AI while mitigating associated risks, ensuring that advancements in AI contribute to a more equitable, efficient, and transparent global trade system. Emphasizing the broader implications, the integration of AI technologies is posited as a cornerstone for promoting free trade and opening up the world economy. By reducing barriers and enhancing access, AI has the potential to drive global economic integration and foster a more interconnected market environment. This vision aligns with contemporary global trade objectives, advocating for a harmonious blend of technology and traditional trade principles to navigate the complexities of modern international relations and trade policies.

By adopting a building-blocks approach (combining distinct definitional components of soft law), the paper shows that the state of current soft law on AI depends on which position on international law one defends. Concretely, the paper firstly offers a complete codebook for identifying the different types of soft law. Secondly, it applies this codebook as a proof-of-concept for the research proposal by analyzing 40+ ethical guidelines and by clustering preliminary results according to the actor enacting the guidelines and the legally relevant effects they could deploy. Four paradigmatic types of soft law emerge: statist and international organization soft law, process-oriented soft law, expertise -oriented soft law, and de facto relevant standards soft law.

Contrary to existing literature, this article suggests that the most far-reaching and effective EU rules for AI applications in the digital economy will not be contained in the proposed AI Act, but in the Digital Markets Act (DMA). We analyse the impact of the DMA and related EU acts on AI models and underlying data across four key areas: disclosure requirements; the regulation of AI training data; access rules; and the regime for fair rankings. We demonstrate that fairness, under the DMA, goes beyond traditionally protected categories of non-discrimination law on which scholarship at the intersection of AI and law has focused on. Rather, we draw on competition law and the FRAND criteria known from intellectual property law to interpret and refine the DMA provisions on fair rankings. Moreover, we show how, based on Court of Justice of the European Union jurisprudence, a coherent interpretation of the concept of non-discrimination in both traditional non-discrimination and competition law may be found. The final section sketches out proposals for a comprehensive framework of transparency, access and fairness under the DMA and beyond.","2024-03","2024-10-27 16:07:55","2024-10-27 16:07:55","","49-86","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001125220300001","","","","","","","AI; AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING; data; DISCRIMINATION; DMA; INNOVATION EVIDENCE; TRADE SECRETS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By automating complex decisions and processing extensive datasets, AI promises to enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of trade and dispute resolution. This research delves into AI's potential applications within the WTO, highlighting how predictive analytics and decision support systems could transform trade dispute resolutions. However, the integration of AI also presents challenges, including ethical concerns, the need for transparency, and data privacy issues. Balancing these challenges with the benefits of AI is crucial to maintaining fairness and accuracy in legal processes. This paper advocates for international collaboration to establish standards guiding AI applications in international trade and dispute resolution, ensuring that technological advancements support the WTO's goals without compromising the integrity of the legal system. A new legal framework is essential to harness the full potential of AI while mitigating associated risks, ensuring that advancements in AI contribute to a more equitable, efficient, and transparent global trade system. Emphasizing the broader implications, the integration of AI technologies is posited as a cornerstone for promoting free trade and opening up the world economy. By reducing barriers and enhancing access, AI has the potential to drive global economic integration and foster a more interconnected market environment. This vision aligns with contemporary global trade objectives, advocating for a harmonious blend of technology and traditional trade principles to navigate the complexities of modern international relations and trade policies. The exploration of AI's role across these dimensions underscores the broad and impactful nature of technological progress on the fabric of international trade and law, echoing the urgent call for adaptive strategies that embrace technological advancements while upholding the principles of free and fair trade.","2024","2024-10-27 16:08:24","2024-10-27 16:08:24","","","","1","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001250310400002","","","","","","","artificial intelligence; arbitration; automation in trade disputes; decision support systems; dispute settlement; international trade law; predictive analytics; sustainable trade policies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building upon the definitions of soft law discussed in legal scholarship, it proposes a way of structuring the regulatory landscape on AI and of addressing the question of what is included in the ""soft law of AI"" today. By adopting a building-blocks approach (combining distinct definitional components of soft law), the paper shows that the state of current soft law on AI depends on which position on international law one defends. Concretely, the paper firstly offers a complete codebook for identifying the different types of soft law. Secondly, it applies this codebook as a proof-of-concept for the research proposal by analyzing 40+ ethical guidelines and by clustering preliminary results according to the actor enacting the guidelines and the legally relevant effects they could deploy. Four paradigmatic types of soft law emerge: statist and international organization soft law, process-oriented soft law, expertise -oriented soft law, and de facto relevant standards soft law. These results illustrate the contributions which are to be expected from a law-as-data research proposal.","2022","2024-10-27 16:08:24","2024-10-27 16:08:24","","37-59","","1","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001000908400003","","","","","","","LEGAL; AI; AUTOMATION; HARD; International law; Law as Data; Legal Theory; Soft Law; Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the realm of legal document composition, a pivotal component revolves around accurately referencing case laws and other sources to substantiate assertions and arguments. Understanding the legal domain and identifying appropriate citation context or cite-worthy sentences automatically is challenging. Our research is centered on the issue of citation-worthiness identification of a given sentence. This serves as the initial phase in contemporary citation recommendation systems, aimed at alleviating the effort involved in extracting a suitable array of citation contexts. To address this, we first introduce a labeled dataset comprising 178 million sentences, specifically tailored for detecting citation-worthy content within the legal domain. This dataset is curated from the Caselaw Access Project (CAP)(2) (https://case.law/). We proceeded to assess the performance of a range of deep learning models on this novel dataset. Among the models examined, the domain-specific pre-trained model consistently demonstrated superior performance, achieving an 88% F1-score in the task of detecting citation-worthy material. To enhance our insights, we employed inputXGradient explainable AI techniques to dissect the predictions, thereby identifying the tokens that contribute to specific citation classes.","2023","2024-10-27 16:08:25","2024-10-27 16:08:25","","257-262","","","379","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001175464100031","","","","","","","Classification; Legal NLP; Citation","","Spanakis, J; VanDijck, G; Sileno, G","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LEGAL KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper begins by investigating the methodological challenges in documenting and verifying the 90th-percentile claim, presenting four sets of findings that indicate that OpenAI's estimates of GPT-4's UBE percentile are overinflated. First, although GPT-4's UBE score nears the 90th percentile when examining approximate conversions from February administrations of the Illinois Bar Exam, these estimates are heavily skewed towards repeat test-takers who failed the July administration and score significantly lower than the general test-taking population. Second, data from a recent July administration of the same exam suggests GPT-4's overall UBE percentile was below the 69th percentile, and similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 48th percentile on essays. Third, examining official NCBE data and using several conservative statistical assumptions, GPT-4's performance against first-time test takers is estimated to be similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 62nd percentile, including similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 42nd percentile on essays. Fourth, when examining only those who passed the exam (i.e. licensed or license-pending attorneys), GPT-4's performance is estimated to drop to similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 48th percentile overall, and similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 15th percentile on essays. In addition to investigating the validity of the percentile claim, the paper also investigates the validity of GPT-4's reported scaled UBE score of 298. The paper successfully replicates the MBE score, but highlights several methodological issues in the grading of the MPT + MEE components of the exam, which call into question the validity of the reported essay score. Finally, the paper investigates the effect of different hyperparameter combinations on GPT-4's MBE performance, finding no significant effect of adjusting temperature settings, and a significant effect of few-shot chain-of-thought prompting over basic zero-shot prompting. Taken together, these findings carry timely insights for the desirability and feasibility of outsourcing legally relevant tasks to AI models, as well as for the importance for AI developers to implement rigorous and transparent capabilities evaluations to help secure safe and trustworthy AI.","2024-03-30","2024-10-27 16:12:06","2024-10-27 16:12:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001194581100001","","","","","","","NLP; Machine learning; Natural language processing; LAW; Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence and law; Law and technology; Legal analytics; Legal NLP; Legal profession","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The article deploys a form of computational natural language processing, using a large-language model machine learning process (GPT-3) to extract data from online Federal Court dockets. The article reviews patterns in outcomes in thousands of stay of removal applications identified through this process and reveals a wide range in stay grant rates across many justices. The article argues that the Federal Court should take measures to encourage more consistency in stay decision-making and cautions against relying heavily on stays of removal to ensure that deportation complies with constitutional procedural justice protections. The article is also a demonstration of how machine learning can be used to pursue empirical legal research projects that would have been cost prohibitive or technically challenging only a few years ago-and shows how technology that is increasingly used to enhance the power of the state at the expense of marginalized migrants can instead be used to scrutinize legal decision-making in the immigration law field, hopefully in ways that enhance the rights of migrants. The article also contributes to the broader field of computational legal research in Canada by making available to other non-commercial researchers the code used for the project, as well as a dataset of several thousand Federal Court dockets that can be used for future research.","2024","2024-10-27 16:12:06","2024-10-27 16:12:06","","73-126","","2","49","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001245221700003","","","","","","","REFUGEE DETERMINATIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the realm of legal document composition, a pivotal component revolves around accurately referencing case laws and other sources to substantiate assertions and arguments. Understanding the legal domain and identifying appropriate citation context or cite-worthy sentences automatically is challenging. Our research is centered on the issue of citation-worthiness identification of a given sentence. This serves as the initial phase in contemporary citation recommendation systems, aimed at alleviating the effort involved in extracting a suitable array of citation contexts. To address this, we first introduce a labeled dataset comprising 178 million sentences, specifically tailored for detecting citation-worthy content within the legal domain. This dataset is curated from the Caselaw Access Project (CAP)(2) (https://case.law/). We proceeded to assess the performance of a range of deep learning models on this novel dataset. Among the models examined, the domain-specific pre-trained model consistently demonstrated superior performance, achieving an 88% F1-score in the task of detecting citation-worthy material. To enhance our insights, we employed inputXGradient explainable AI techniques to dissect the predictions, thereby identifying the tokens that contribute to specific citation classes.","2023","2024-10-27 16:12:43","2024-10-27 16:12:43","","257-262","","","379","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001175464100031","","","","","","","Classification; Legal NLP; Citation","","Spanakis, J; VanDijck, G; Sileno, G","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LEGAL KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The variety of exceptional measures adopted in countries characterized by different legal systems and natural languages, as well as the rapid evolution of such measures, pose considerable challenges to manual textual analysis methods traditionally used in the social sciences. To address these challenges, we develop a supervised classifier to support the manual coding of exceptional policies by a multinational team of human coders.

While data or information are not subject matter within copyright law, almost all materials used to construct corpora for machine learning are protected by copyright law: texts, images, videos, and so on. There are global policy moves to address the copyright implications of machine learning, in particular in the context of so-called ""foundation models"" that underpin generative AI. This paper takes a step back, exploring empirically three technological settings through detailed case studies. We set out the established industry methodology of a lifecycle of AI (collecting data, organising data, model training, model operation) to arrive at descriptions suitable for legal analysis. This will allow an assessment of the challenges for a harmonisation of rights, exceptions and disclosure under EU copyright law. The three case studies are:Machine learning for scientific purposes, in the context of a study of regional short-term letting markets;Natural Language Processing (NLP), in the context of large language models;Computer vision, in the context of content moderation of images.We find that the nature and quality of data corpora at the input stage is central to the lifecycle of machine learning. Because of the uncertain legal status of data collection and processing, combined with the competitive advantage gained by firms not disclosing technological advances, the inputs of the models deployed are often unknown. Moreover, the ""lawful access"" requirement of the EU exception for text and data mining may turn the exception into a decision by rightholders to allow machine learning in the context of their decision to allow access. We assess policy interventions at EU level, seeking to clarify the legal status of input data via copyright exceptions, opt-outs or the forced disclosure of copyright materials. We find that the likely result is a fully copyright-licensed environment of machine learning that may have problematic effects for the structure of industry, innovation and scientific research.","2024-01","2024-10-27 16:13:26","2024-10-27 16:13:26","","110-138","","1","55","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001155789200001","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Copyright; Data mining; Digital single market; EU; TEXT; Text mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has the potential to form the basis for further transformation of the national model of justice. This study's impetus may have risen from the realisation that relying solely on human resources for such endeavours may present challenges.Methods: The study is based on the hypothesis that using hardware and software to analyse large data sets of state registers of court decisions and judicial statistics data can identify persistent patterns and causes of inefficient functioning of the judicial system.Results and Conclusions: The study led to the development of software with functionality that annotates court decision text, intended for further use in advanced Natural Language Processing algorithms. Furthermore, the study underscores the need to develop an algorithm for predicting risks and outcomes of court proceedings and a methodology for processing large amounts of data from the Unified State Register of Court Decisions.

The initial proposal for the management and governance of the AI sector was submitted in April 2021. Three years later, on 13 March 2024, the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AIA) was adopted by the European Parliament. Subsequently, on 21 May 2024, the Council adopted an innovative legislative framework that harmonises the standards and rules for AI regulation. This framework is set to take effect in May 2026, with the central objective of stimulating and motivating a fair, safe, legal single market that respects the principles of ethics and the fundamental rights of the human person. Methods: The current legal analysis focuses on the European Unions' new institutional governance involving a multistage approach to managing health data, ethical artificial intelligence, generative artificial intelligence and classification of types of AI by considering the degree of risk (e.g. artificial intelligence systems with limited risk and systems with high risk) and medical devices. It outlines the legal framework for AI regulation and governance in the EU by focusing on compliance with the previously adopted legislation in the Medical Devices Regulation (2017) and the In-Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (2017). The paper also examines the application of the newly adopted EU Artificial Intelligence Act in relation to national justice systems, previous EU regulations on medical devices and personal data protection regulation, and its correlation with the European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence. This opens up complex discussions related to judicial reform and access to justice. For this purpose, as a research objective, the legal analysis includes an innovative perspective following an integrative discussion on the latest legal reforms and regulations of the AI sector in Eastern Europe launched in 2024 with a special focus on the latest developments in the EU Candidate Countries namely Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova.

We analyse the impact of the DMA and related EU acts on AI models and underlying data across four key areas: disclosure requirements; the regulation of AI training data; access rules; and the regime for fair rankings. We demonstrate that fairness, under the DMA, goes beyond traditionally protected categories of non-discrimination law on which scholarship at the intersection of AI and law has focused on. Rather, we draw on competition law and the FRAND criteria known from intellectual property law to interpret and refine the DMA provisions on fair rankings. Moreover, we show how, based on Court of Justice of the European Union jurisprudence, a coherent interpretation of the concept of non-discrimination in both traditional non-discrimination and competition law may be found.

The ACLU sued Clearview for collecting billions of our personal- but publicly available-photos, a violation not only of BIPA but also of the user agreements of websites like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Clearview uses these photos to create the largest known facial recognition database. Clearview's technology, which it licenses to law enforcement agencies across the country, can identify a face in a matter of seconds. As privacy and technology continue to clash, ACLU v. Clearview, Inc. provided an opportunity to address the underlying constitutional tension between the First Amendment and privacy.

"Q4HMTKFE","journalArticle","2022","Devany, BE","Clearview AI's First Amendment: A Dangerous Reality?","TEXAS LAW REVIEW","","0040-4411","","","On May 9, 2022, Clearview AI and the ACLU settled a two-year long dispute over the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), which prohibits companies like Clearview from scraping mass amounts of data from the internet. The ACLU sued Clearview for collecting billions of our personal- but publicly available-photos, a violation not only of BIPA but also of the user agreements of websites like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Clearview uses these photos to create the largest known facial recognition database. Clearview's technology, which it licenses to law enforcement agencies across the country, can identify a face in a matter of seconds. As privacy and technology continue to clash, ACLU v. Clearview, Inc. provided an opportunity to address the underlying constitutional tension between the First Amendment and privacy. But since the suit settled, these questions remain unanswered.Clearview claims it has a First Amendment right to scrape data and sell its facial recognition service.

The initial proposal for the management and governance of the AI sector was submitted in April 2021. Three years later, on 13 March 2024, the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AIA) was adopted by the European Parliament. Subsequently, on 21 May 2024, the Council adopted an innovative legislative framework that harmonises the standards and rules for AI regulation. This framework is set to take effect in May 2026, with the central objective of stimulating and motivating a fair, safe, legal single market that respects the principles of ethics and the fundamental rights of the human person. Methods: The current legal analysis focuses on the European Unions' new institutional governance involving a multistage approach to managing health data, ethical artificial intelligence, generative artificial intelligence and classification of types of AI by considering the degree of risk (e.g. artificial intelligence systems with limited risk and systems with high risk) and medical devices. It outlines the legal framework for AI regulation and governance in the EU by focusing on compliance with the previously adopted legislation in the Medical Devices Regulation (2017) and the In-Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (2017). The paper also examines the application of the newly adopted EU Artificial Intelligence Act in relation to national justice systems, previous EU regulations on medical devices and personal data protection regulation, and its correlation with the European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence. This opens up complex discussions related to judicial reform and access to justice. For this purpose, as a research objective, the legal analysis includes an innovative perspective following an integrative discussion on the latest legal reforms and regulations of the AI sector in Eastern Europe launched in 2024 with a special focus on the latest developments in the EU Candidate Countries namely Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova. Results and conclusions: The present research facilitates the exploration of the real benefits of managing innovative AI systems for medical data, research, and development, as well as within the medical technology industry.","2024-09-02","2024-10-27 16:14:17","2024-10-27 16:14:17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001304269100001","","","","","","","AI; artificial intelligence; generative AI; ethical AI; EU legislation; medical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
