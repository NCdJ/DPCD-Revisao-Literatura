AB  - The use of generative AI systems is on the rise. As a result, we are increasingly often conversing with AI chatbots rather than with fellow humans. This increasing use of AI systems leads to legal challenges as well, particularly when the chatbot provides incorrect information. In this article, we study whether someone who decides to contract on the basis of incorrect information provided by a generative AI chatbot might invoke the fraud regime to annul the resulting contract in various legal systems. During this analysis, it becomes clear that some of the requirements that are currently being put forward from a public law perspective, such as in the European AI Act, may also naturally arise from existing private law figures. In the same vein, this analysis highlights the interesting intradisciplinary feedback between instruments of public law and other legal domains.

AB  - While it is important to research the negative impact of generative artificial intelligence on academic integrity, academics should focus most of their efforts on the opportunities these technologies present for improving pedagogical practices. In this note, I attempt to flip the narrative from one of fear to one of opportunity. I suggest that academics should research the use of generative AI to improve teaching effectiveness and efficiency. I offer various practical suggestions on how these tools can be used to advance pedagogical practices, with specific business law examples.

AB  - The recent commercial release of a new generation of chatbot systems, particularly those leveraging Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has caught the world by surprise and sparked debate about their potential consequences for society. While concerns about the existential threat posed by these technologies are often discussed, it is crucial to shift our focus towards the more immediate risks associated with their deployment. Such risks are further compounded by the lack of proactive measures addressing users' literacy and the for-profit model via which these chatbots are distributed. Drawing on research in computer science and other fields, this paper looks at the immediate risks triggered by these products and reflects on the role of law within a broader policy directed at steering generative artificial intelligence technology towards the common good. It also reviews the relevant amendments proposed by the European Parliament to the European Commission's proposal for an AI Act.

KW  - COMPUTER-ART
KW  - INTELLIGENCE
AB  - Images and animations created through generative artificial intelligence (GAI) pose new possibilities and questions for the law of demonstrative evidence. AI art tools may allow parties to prepare pedagogical displays-including hyper-realistic virtual imagery- without retaining expensive third-party artists. But these programs raise evidentiary concerns such as reliability and undue prejudice, issues that remain largely unaddressed under the notoriously undeveloped law governing computer-made demonstratives. This Note explains both how artificial intelligence companies could institute initiatives for better quality assurance at the front end, and how courts can encourage such measures through new applications of existing evidentiary and procedural rules. The Note ultimately argues that the emerging use of GAI imagery may necessitate stricter standards in demonstrative evidence law.

T2  - HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - The music industry stands on the brink of a crisis. With unpredictable judicial standards that are inconsistent across the country, plaintiffs seeking to protect their musical works against copyright infringement face a heavy burden of proof, especially when facing defendants who are more wellknown and more well-funded. Not only that, but plaintiffs may not receive their day in court given that powerhouse artists like Taylor Swift, Sam Smith, and Bruno Mars have chosen to settle rather than defend their musical works in court. Now, Generative Artificial Intelligence ("Generative A.I.") and A.I.-generated music will inevitably send the music industry into a tailspin-and the law is not ready to grapple with the complexities that will arise. To wit, Generative A.I. is poised to threaten the very principles on which copyright law is founded: To encourage (human) creativity by protecting original works of expression. This Note seeks to protect human music copyright holders against the ever-growing threat of A.I.-generated music. Part I addresses A.I. technology and the legal uncertainties associated with A.I.-generated music. Part II discusses the current doctrine of music copyright infringement. Part III offers a series of proposals for how to adapt the current doctrine to ensure music copyright holders can protect their original works of human authorship against A.I.-generated works.

AB  - Since the beginning of 2023, generative artificial intelligence (hereinafter "Generative AI") in the form of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-4 has taken the world by storm. Legal practice is no exception. Among other stories, worldwide headlines have featured the fact that ChatGPT-4 is capable of passing the New York Bar Exam, that courts are adopting Generative AI in their decision-making, and that a New York lawyer has been sanctioned by a judge for relying upon non-existent case law precedent that he obtained from ChatGPT-4 and did not double-check.
   Yet, putting aside these newsworthy developments, tools powered by other forms of artificial intelligence (hereinafter "AI") have already been relied upon in legal practice for many years. This article introduces how AI supports successful international arbitration practice, including uses and methods that are already available and those that are anticipated to become helpful. This article also addresses the challenges and pitfalls that accompany these opportunities. Overall, this article concludes that the brave new world of AI in international arbitration is an exciting one that, through careful and thoughtful deployment of best practices, can add significant value to international arbitration teams in the decades to come.

TI  - Assessing law students in a GenAI world to create knowledgeable future lawyers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION
LA  - English
AB  - Assessing law students has always been a challenging task, but the introduction of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), such as ChatGPT, compounds the problems already caused by increased student numbers, contract cheating and budget cuts in universities. As GenAI rapidly develops, legal educators must find ways to accommodate, and even incorporate, GenAI into their curricula and assessments so that law graduates can understand its capabilities and limitations within legal practice. Simultaneously, many jurisdictions, including Australia, have legislative obligations to deliver law graduates who satisfy legal knowledge-based "eligibility" requirements for admission into practice. This article introduces a knowledge framework for managing GenAI in legal education consisting of three pillars: Substantive Legal Knowledge, GenAI Ethics Knowledge, and GenAI System Knowledge. The authors argue this framework can assist legal educators in designing optimal assessments in an AI-disrupted world. The article employs the knowledge framework to examine the experiences and views of Australian law students' engagement with GenAI outputs in completing a compulsory legal ethics assessment in 2023. This empirical case study demonstrates that effective assessment design incorporating GenAI can enhance law student and graduate outcomes despite the ongoing challenges for legal educators and the profession associated with GenAI.

TI  - RETHINKING THE PRESUMPTION OF ENABLEMENT IN NONPATENT PRIOR ART
T2  - DUKE LAW JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - PATENTS
KW  - INFORMATION
AB  - The rising popularity of tools such as preprint servers, open-access data sources, and generative artificial intelligence has resulted in a proliferation of prior art that has never been seen before under the current patent system. In a rapidly changing world, patent law is slow to catch up, and the current system is not equipped to handle the flood of incoming prior art. In the academic research setting in particular, while the use of preprint servers and open-source data has allowed researchers to participate in widespread information exchange, these tools have also generated a new, large class of prior art dedicated to early-stage research. This creates a tension with patent law, which assigns a presumption of enablement to nonpatent prior art, including preprint disclosures. Essentially, the law presumes that any public disclosure of an invention contains enough detail to instruct the public to make and use it. Thus, any public disclosure "starts the clock" on an applicant's time to get to the patent office. This Note explores how that presumption artificially incentivizes premature patent filing, decreasing the overall quality of patents entering the patent system.

This novel combination effectively and feasibly addresses the hallucination issue of large language models (LLMs) in critical domains, such as law. Through this system, we demonstrate how incorporating a legal knowledge base and logical reasoning can enhance the accuracy and reliability of legal advice provided by AI models like GPT. Though our work is primarily a demonstration, it provides a framework to explore how knowledge bases and logic programming structures can be further integrated with generative AI systems, to achieve improved results across various natural languages and legal systems.

As different jurisdictions are in the process of "catching up" to the technology, this paper argues that compulsory mediation, as an alternate dispute resolution, has the potential to address legal uncertainties. The flexible and informal nature of the compulsory mediation process makes a suitable environment for all stakeholders involved, the right owners, the creators, and the users of the AI, to come to an agreement, thus lessening the impact such new invention brings to domestic legal framework. Moreover, by looking into compulsory mediations in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Turkey, this paper hopes to outline key factors for compulsory mediation to properly tackle the subject of intellectual property disputes of AI nature.

The article takes as its premise the definition of academic integrity as a set of values and argues that a series of risks arise from the GAI that threaten those values, such as excessive dependence and trust in the GAI, the unreallizability of the pedagogical project and the loss of competitiveness of educational institutions, among others. To minimize or nullify such risks, and thus prevent them from affecting academic integrity, four mitigation measures are identified to be applied in university environments.

This study evaluates commercially available CAs within the German legal context, thereby assessing the generalizability of previous U.S.-based findings. Employing a unique corpus of 200 distinct legal tasks, ChatGPT-4 was benchmarked against Google Bard, Google Gemini, and its predecessor, ChatGPT-3.5. Human-expert and automated assessments of 4000 CA-generated responses reveal ChatGPT-4 to be the first CA to surpass the threshold of solving realistic legal tasks and passing a German business law exam. While ChatGPT-4 outperforms ChatGPT-3.5, Google Bard, and Google Gemini in both consistency and quality, the results demonstrate a considerable degree of variability, especially in complex cases with no predefined response options. Based on these findings, legal professionals should manually verify all texts produced by CAs before use. Novices must exercise caution with CA-generated legal advice, given the expertise needed for its assessment.

AB  - On 15 August 2023, China's new rules on generative artificial intelligence (AI) entered into force. This article explores the underlying reasons and context for this rapid regulatory development. It argues that China's swift adoption of the Interim Measures on generative AI has been enabled by its traditional approach to digital policy, together with its renewed system of governance and the extensive work that Chinese regulators had conducted on AI ethics and relevant principles. The article also analyses some of the substantial rules laid down by the Interim Measures, offering scholars and policymakers working on generative AI regulation in other jurisdictions the possibility to engage with the solutions chosen by the Chinese regulators. To this end, the article brielfy presents key provisions regarding training data and IP rights; labelling of synthetic content; algorithm registration; accountability for content; and the applicability of existing laws to generative AI. It compares these aspects of the Interim Measures with examples from the European Union and the United States.

AB  - On November 30, 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT conversational artificial intelligence; with the latest version update, ChatGPT has demonstrated an impressive ability to understand natural language, making it an attractive tool for companies and individuals looking to provide customer service and support. GPT-3 uses textual data, mostly from publicly available information on the Internet, as training data. GPT-4, on the other hand, uses a large number of images in addition to textual data for training, and thus can process both textual and graphical data. The emergence of generative AI has greatly impacted human life, but it can be said that intelligent technology is a double-edged sword:rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, on the one hand, it can improve efficiency and productivity, reduce costs and open new opportunities for economic growth, but on the other hand, the use of generative AI services to create synthetic content in the form of text, audio, video and images poses possible risks. To date, different regions around the world are at different stages of development of normative acts concerning generative AI.Using the comparative legal method and the method of system analysis, this article analyzes in detail the main models of legal regulation of generative AI in the modern world on the example of the UK, the USA, the European Union and China, noting the different approach in the development and adoption of relevant normative legal acts in the field of regulation of generative AI services.It especially reveals the Chinese government's position on "development and security" and "innovation and governance" at present. The main trends of improving the regulation of generative AI services by China are proposed, and it is concluded that it is necessary to balance "rule of law" and "innovation" and promote the healthy development of generative AI.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools produce hallucinations exposing developers and users to a myriad of liabilities in courts. Given the absence of strict laws and regulations structuring how Generative AI content interact with potential allegations of defamation, libel, and slander, judges and attorneys are left with the semiotics of the fragmented articles and rules in each system attempting to settle such cases. The endless interpretations of written and non-verbal signs in the law across the world constitutes a new realm for legal semiotics in the area of Generative AI and defamation. The present analysis examines existing civil liability articles in the Jordanian code to shed light on the litigation and defenses afforded in the defamation realm with respect to Generative AI content. The key finding is that like other countries, civil codes in Jordan are outdated concerning Generative AI content opening a plethora of liability scenarios in libel or slander cases. More importantly, the exercise of semiotic interpretation generates several defenses salvaging users and developers under strict sets of conditions. In sum, new amendments and updated legislative frameworks are needed to protect the healthy development of Generative AI while preserving citizens from damaging defamation, libel, and slander.

AB  - With highly humanlike responding abilities enabled by generative artificial intelligence (hereinafter "AI"), ChatGPT astonished the world instantly after its launch on November 30, 2022. As ChatGPT has demonstrated the capabilities of AI to analyze and solve complex tasks, we are one step closer to the point where AI will have the technological capability of serving as an arbitrator to analyze legal issues and apply the correct laws and rules to the facts. In light of the technological advancement of AI, instead of the previous question of whether AI will be able to serve as an arbitrator, the current question seems to be when AI will be able to serve as an arbitrator. This article discusses the potential of AI serving as arbitrators from both a technological and legal perspective. We find that AI technologies still have some way to go before reaching the maturity to serve as arbitrators. But even when AI reaches the required maturity, we believe whether AI can serve as an arbitrator will eventually depend on the public's trust in AI to make potentially life -changing decisions.

AB  - center dot Three significant lawsuits concerning generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) were filed in the USA, starting the first wave of lawsuits against AI: (i) coders filed claims for the alleged use of their codes by OpenAI's CoPilot, (ii) visual artists filed claims against companies using Stable Diffusion and (iii) Getty Images filed claims against Stability AI, which uses Stable Diffusion. Following the lead of these lawsuits, copyright owners of literary works filed four other lawsuits against OpenAI, Meta and Alphabet (Google)'s large language models. All of these lawsuits are pending at the time of writing.
   center dot Among other things, plaintiffs filed claims challenging generative AI's lack of attribution to copyright owners of in-copyright works in its training data. As US copyright law does not protect moral rights strongly, a federal rule granting a right of attribution to all copyright owners does not exist. Yet, there are some provisions providing quasi-protection. Section 1202 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is one of them and protects copyright owners against removal/modification of the Copyright Management Information in connection with their works.
   center dot This article lays down the limitations of moral rights protection in the USA and demonstrates the difficulties faced by the plaintiffs of the pending lawsuits. The limitations of Section 1202 DMCA are explained to demonstrate its difference from a classic moral right of attribution. The outcomes of these lawsuits will be significant in building case law on generative AI for the first time in the USA. This article evaluates the benefits and disadvantages of courts' possible acceptance of plaintiffs' claims regarding attribution.

AB  - This Essay draws connections between Octavia Butler's Parable series ( Parable of the Sower and Parable of the Talents), ), HBO's Westworld, , and Derrick Bell's Faces at the Bottom of the Well: The Permanence of Racism to highlight how the reconfiguration and transmutation of race through technological change is facilitated by corresponding shifts in legal doctrine, theory, policy, and practice. It takes the overlapping threads from these three sources, which struggle with the idea of change within larger systems of unavoidable, repetitive destruction, and ties them to the law's role in helping to shield race through the storms of change by being similarly nimble, flexible, and perseverant. The Essay identifies a theme found in both the selected Afrofuturistic works and in tech-centered legal doctrine, regulation, and theory that illuminate the law's role in reconstituting the fraught relationship between race and technology: the promise of utopia. The Essay explores this concept in the context of emerging debates on the function, utility, and harm of generative artificial intelligence (AI), which has been promoted as the latest tool toward a transhumanist future devoid of the trappings of humanity's biggest flaws. It proposes four emanating values, Ustopia, Sankofa, Data Justice, and Data Power, which should help guide advocacy, policymaking, and resistance in an increasingly AI dominated future. It ultimately concludes that an Afrofuturistic lens is not only important for understanding the potential harms of AI and developing regulatory frameworks but also necessary for imagining how such technologies could serve the interests of radical Black futures. The Essay contributes to a burgeoning literature using Afrofuturism-which situates the Black struggle in persistent yet continuously changing structural disparities and power relations-as an important departure point for expressing data precarity and reimagining new modes of data protection.

AB  - Francis Bacon says knowledge is power. The creation of knowledge and its dissemination largely depends on the creation of literary works. The great works of Shakespeare, da Vinci, Homer, Picasso, Milton, Tagore etc. have been a treasure trove of mankind. Human beings have enjoyed the work, been inspired by the work, taken joy and eternal bliss in such works. However, the creation of knowledge is dependent on pre-existing knowledge. Creators create a work which requires hard work, imagination, creativity and which is incentivised by recognition of their work. The legal order of a couth society affords protection to such a work by copyright law & fair use. Fair use allows a person to use a work by duly acknowledging and referencing the work. Issue of plagiarism and abuse of fair use was aggravated by human greed. The economic implication of copyright infringement aggravated the whole issue. Referencing turned into war. The Bluebook, the Maroonbook, the ALWD, the APA and OSCOLA citation styles engaged in some kind of a war. Reference management systems like Zotero, Endnote, Mendeley etc. just fanned the flame. Disruptive and generative artificial intelligence has created a serious challenge to academic research. In this paper, the author attempts to delve into the inter-linkage of academic writing, research, citation, copyright, referencing mechanism and plagiarism in contemporary society, and the aftermath of it. The author attempts to investigate the challenges of writing and the protection of works vis-a-vis referencing tools and techniques.

KW  - text and data mining exception
AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems, together with text and data mining (TDM), introduce complex challenges at the junction of data utilization and copyright laws. The inherent reliance of AI on large quantities of data, often encompassing copyrighted materials, results in multifaceted legal quandaries. Issues surface from the unfeasible task of securing permission from each copyright holder for AI training, further muddled by ambiguities in interpreting copyright laws and fair use provisions. Adding to the conundrum, the clandestine practices of data collection in proprietary AI systems obstruct copyright owners from detecting unauthorized use of their materials. The paper explores the exceptions to copyright laws for TDM in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Japan, recognizing their crucial role in fostering AI development. The EU has a two-pronged approach under the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, with one exception catering specifically to research organizations, and another, more generalized one, that can be restricted by rightsholders. The UK allows noncommercial TDM research without infringement but rejected a broader copyright exception due to concerns from the creative sector. Japan has the broadest TDM exception globally, permitting the nonenjoyment use of works without permission, though this can potentially overlook the rights of copyright owners. Notably, the applicability of TDM exceptions to AI-produced copies remains unclear, creating potential legal challenges. Furthermore, an exploration of the fair use doctrine in the United States provides insight into its potential application in AI development. It focuses on the transformative aspect of usage and its impact on the original work's potential market. This exploration underscores the necessity for clear, practical guidelines. In response to these identified challenges, this paper proposes a hybrid model for TDM exceptions emerges, along with recommended specific mechanisms. The model divides exceptions into noncommercial and commercial uses, providing a nuanced solution to complex copyright issues in AI training. Recommendations incorporate mandatory exceptions for noncommercial uses, an opt-out clause for commercial uses, enhanced transparency measures, and a searchable portal for copyright owners. In conclusion, striking a delicate equilibrium between technological progress and the incentive for creative expression is of paramount importance. These suggested solutions aim to establish a harmonious foundation that nurtures innovation and creativity while honoring creators' rights, facilitating AI development, promoting transparency, and ensuring fair compensation for creators.

AB  - The European Union (EU) text and data mining (TDM) provisions are a progressive move, but the horizon is still uncertain for both generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models researchers and developers. This article suggests that to drive innovation and further the commitment to the digital single market, during the national implementation, EU Member States could consider taking the Japanese broad, all-encompassing and "nonenjoyment-based" TDM as an example. The Japanese "nonenjoyment" purposes, however, are not foreign to the European continental view of copyright. A similar concept can be found under the German concept of "Freier Werkgenuss" or enjoyment of the work. A flexible TDM exception built upon the German notion of nonenjoyment purposes could become an opening clause to foster innovation and creativity in the age of GenAI. Moreover, the article argues that an opening clause allowing TDM with "nonenjoyment" purposes could be permissible under the so-called three-step test. This article further suggests, if there is no political will to safeguard "the right to read should be the right to mine" and to provide a welcoming environment for GenAI researchers and developers, when shaping the legal interpretation through national case law, the EU Member States could consider the following: (1) advocate for 72 h of response if technological protection measures (TPMs) are preventing TDM, and (2) Robot Exclusion Standard (robot.txt) as a warning when TDM is not allowed on a website. It is now in the hands of the EU Member States, whether to protect the interests of rightholders or to create a balance between safeguarding "the right to read should be the right to mine," protecting rightholders exclusivity, and creating a supportive environment for the GenAI models researcher and developers.

AB  - Background: This study correlates the up-to-date ethical, functional and legal evaluations related to the management and governance of artificial intelligence (AI) under European Union (EU) law, particularly impacting the health data sector and medical standards as provided by the Artificial Intelligence Act within the Regulation adopted by the European Council in May 2024. The initial proposal for the management and governance of the AI sector was submitted in April 2021. Three years later, on 13 March 2024, the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AIA) was adopted by the European Parliament. Subsequently, on 21 May 2024, the Council adopted an innovative legislative framework that harmonises the standards and rules for AI regulation. This framework is set to take effect in May 2026, with the central objective of stimulating and motivating a fair, safe, legal single market that respects the principles of ethics and the fundamental rights of the human person. Methods: The current legal analysis focuses on the European Unions' new institutional governance involving a multistage approach to managing health data, ethical artificial intelligence, generative artificial intelligence and classification of types of AI by considering the degree of risk (e.g. artificial intelligence systems with limited risk and systems with high risk) and medical devices. It outlines the legal framework for AI regulation and governance in the EU by focusing on compliance with the previously adopted legislation in the Medical Devices Regulation (2017) and the In-Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (2017). The paper also examines the application of the newly adopted EU Artificial Intelligence Act in relation to national justice systems, previous EU regulations on medical devices and personal data protection regulation, and its correlation with the European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence. This opens up complex discussions related to judicial reform and access to justice. For this purpose, as a research objective, the legal analysis includes an innovative perspective following an integrative discussion on the latest legal reforms and regulations of the AI sector in Eastern Europe launched in 2024 with a special focus on the latest developments in the EU Candidate Countries namely Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova. Results and conclusions: The present research facilitates the exploration of the real benefits of managing innovative AI systems for medical data, research, and development, as well as within the medical technology industry.
