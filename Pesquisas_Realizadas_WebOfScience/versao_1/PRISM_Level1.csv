While differences between written 'standard' and legal language have already been analysed with regard to syntactic peculiarities, there is still a lack of findings on the influence of divergent word meanings on comprehensibility. We present the course and the preliminary results of a study elaborating such ambiguities on the basis of over half a million German court decisions. As these differences are highly language-dependent, our study consequentially relates (only) to German.","2023","2024-11-03 11:44:16","2024-11-03 11:44:16","","382-386","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001139079400040","","","","","","","NLP; semantics of legal texts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PROCEEDINGS OF THE 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW, ICAIL 2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the Netherlands, the planned increase in the online publication of case law is expected to exacerbate this challenge. In this paper, we tried to predict whether court decisions are cited by other courts or not after being published, thus in a way distinguishing between more and less authoritative cases. This type of system may be used to process the large amounts of available data by filtering out large quantities of non-authoritative decisions, thus helping legal practitioners and scholars to find relevant decisions more easily, and drastically reducing the time spent on preparation and analysis. For the Dutch Supreme Court, the match between our prediction and the actual data was relatively strong (with a Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.60). Our results were less successful for the Council of State and the district courts (MCC scores of 0.26 and 0.17, relatively). We also attempted to identify the most informative characteristics of a decision. We found that a completely explainable model, consisting only of handcrafted metadata features, performs almost as well as a less well-explainable system based on all text of the decision.","2024-09","2024-11-03 11:44:16","2024-11-03 11:44:16","","807-837","","3","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001018103700001","","","","","","","Case law; Citation analysis; Judicial decisions; Machine learning; Natural language processing; NETWORK ANALYSIS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the argument plays a significant role in the legal field, the interdisciplinary study of AM on legal texts has significant promise. For years, a pipeline architecture has been used as the standard paradigm in this area. Although this simplifies the development and management of AM systems, the connection between different parts of the pipeline causes inevitable shortcomings such as cascading error propagation. This paper presents an alternative perspective of the AM task, whereby legal documents are represented as graph structures and the AM task is undertaken as a hybrid approach incorporating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), graph augmentation and collective classification. GNNs have been demonstrated to be an effective method for representation learning on graphs, and they have been successfully applied to many other NLP tasks. In contrast to previous pipeline-based architecture, our approach results in a single end-to-end classifier for the identification and classification of argumentative text segments. Experiments based on corpora from both the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) show that our approach achieves strong results compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Both the graph augmentation and collective classification steps are shown to improve performance on both datasets when compared to using GNNs alone.","2023","2024-11-03 11:44:17","2024-11-03 11:44:17","","371-380","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001139079400039","","","","","","","Argument Mining; Graph Neural Networks; Legal Text","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PROCEEDINGS OF THE 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW, ICAIL 2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the dataset can be used in a broader context, such as semantic role labeling of Dutch (legal) texts. Our dataset contains 4463 annotated sentences from 55 different Dutch laws, in which four roles are annotated by human annotators: action, actor, object and recipient. The inter-annotator agreement is substantial (kappa =0.75). In experiments with a rule-based and a transformer-based method, results show that the transformerbased method performs quite well on the dataset (accuracy > 0.8). These results indicate that we can reliably predict actions, actors, objects and recipients in legal texts.

While we achieve results with GPT-3 that are better than the previous best published results, we also identify several types of clear errors it makes. We investigate why these errors happen. We discover that GPT-3 has imperfect prior knowledge of the actual U.S. statutes on which SARA is based.

NER is a fundamental task, that identify named entities in text such as people, organizations, and locations. In Legal domain, NER is particularly important due to the variety of named entities that appear in legal documents and are important for legal analysis whereas Semantic classification is the process of giving each sentence in a text a semantic label, such as ""fact,""""arguments,"" or""judgement"". Both NER and Semantic classi- fication are critical component of many NLP applications such as Knowledge base construction and semantic search. Semantic searching of legal documents is a powerful technique that can be used to quickly find the information that you need. By combining NER and semantic classification, one can identify the key elements of a legal document and search for documents that are related to a particular topic or contain a particular type of information. This paper proposes a novel approach to NER and Semantic classification in legal domain using Long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The proposed approach is evaluated on a corpus of legal text and the result of this study suggest that LSTM models are a promising approach for NER and Semantic classification in legal domain and can be used to improve the performance of semantic searching of legal documents.","2024-04-27","2024-11-03 11:44:18","2024-11-03 11:44:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001208833500001","","","","","","","Law; INFORMATION; Legal judgement; Long Short Term Memory(LSTM); Name Entity Recognition(NER)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"NVAWKU42","journalArticle","2024","Choi, JH","Measuring Clarity in Legal Text","UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO LAW REVIEW","","0041-9494","","","Legal cases often turn on judgments of textual clarity: when the text is unclear, judges allow extrinsic evidence in contract disputes, consult legislative history in statutory interpretation, and more. Despite this, almost no empirical work considers the nature or prevalence of legal clarity. Scholars and judges who study real-world documents to inform the interpretation of legal text primarily treat unclear text as a research problem to be solved with more data rather than a fundamental feature of language.This Article makes both theoretical and empirical contributions to the legal concept of textual clarity. It first advances a theory of clarity that distinguishes between information and determinacy. A judge might find text unclear because she personally lacks sufficient information to decide which interpretation is best; alternatively, she might find it unclear because the text itself is fundamentally indeterminate. Fundamental linguistic indeterminacy explains ongoing interpretive debates and limits the potential for text-focused methods (including corpus linguistics) to decide cases.With this theoretical background, the Article then proposes a new method to algorithmically evaluate textual clarity. Applying techniques from natural language processing and artificial intelligence that measure the semantic similarity between words, we can shed valuable new light on questions of legal interpretation.This Article finds that text is frequently indeterminate in real-world legal cases. Moreover, estimates of similarity vary substantially from corpus to corpus, even for large and reputable corpora. This suggests that word use is highly corpus specific and that meaning can vary even between general-purpose corpora that theoretically capture ordinary meaning.These empirical findings have important implications for ongoing doctrinal debates, suggesting that text is less clear and objective than many textualists believe. Ultimately, the Article offers new insights both to theorists considering the role of legal text and to empiricists seeking to understand how text is used in the real world.","2024-01","2024-11-03 11:44:19","2024-11-03 11:44:19","","1-82","","1","91","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001140085100003","","","","","","","LAW; CONSENSUS; CONTRACT INTERPRETATION; CORPUS; DELEGATION; STATUTORY INTERPRETATION; TEXTUALISM; VAGUENESS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is not just about using technologies related to videoconferencing, automated distribution, digital evidence, etc. Development is constantly and rapidly moving forward, and we are now facing issues related to the use of artificial intelligence technologies in criminal proceedings. Such changes also entail new threats and challenges - we are referring to the challenges of respecting fundamental human rights and freedoms in the context of technological development. In addition, there is the matter of ensuring the implementation of basic legal principles, such as the presumption of innocence, non-discrimination and the protection of the right to privacy. This concern arises when applying artificial intelligence systems in the criminal justice system. Methods: The general philosophical framework of this research consisted of axiological and hermeneutic approaches, which allowed us to conduct a value analysis of fundamental human rights and changes in their perception in the context of the AI application, as well as apply in-depth study and interpretation of legal texts. While building up the system of the basic principles of using AI systems in criminal justice, we used the system-structural and logical methods of research. The study also relied on the comparative law method in terms of comparing legal regulation and law enforcement practice in different legal systems. The method of legal modelling was applied to emphasise the main areas of possible application of AI systems in criminal proceedings. Results and Conclusions: The article identifies the main possible vectors of the use of artificial intelligence systems in criminal proceedings and assesses the feasibility and prospects of their implementation. In addition, it is stated that only using AI systems for auxiliary purposes carries minimal risks of interference with human rights and freedoms. Instead, other areas of AI adoption may significantly infringe rights and freedoms, and therefore the use of AI for such purposes should be fully controlled, verified and only subsidiary, and in certain cases, prohibited altogether.","2023-08","2024-11-03 11:44:42","2024-11-03 11:44:42","","147-166","","3","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001069365200001","","","","","","","artificial intelligence; human rights; criminal proceedings; digital technologies; predictive justice, Ukraine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The examination of the AI's legal personality takes into account the modern anthropocentrism standpoint, where humans are perceived as the central figure in the legal system. A human, as a subject of law, plays a crucial role in constructing legal reality. Through exercising his powers, a human transforms abstract norms into existing law. The proposal to delegate this anthropological function to AI carries significant risks that may have detrimental effects on the established system of legal regulation for public relations. The correlation between law-making and law enforcement, as integral components in establishing legal reality, pertains to the legal consciousness of individuals as subjects of law. This correlation does not necessitate the substitution of human decision- making with AI. Simultaneously, AI is capable of effectively handling auxiliary legal tasks. It possesses the necessary skills to draft regulatory acts, court decisions, and consolidate proposals obtained through law-making crowdsourcing. Additionally, it is proficient in executing automated actions, such as issuing writs of execution. The utilization of AI to implement the concept of machine- readable law and algorithmize the application of legal norms appears to hold promise. The incorporation of a digital state notion, which pertains to the transition of public service provision into digital format, is also unattainable without AI, which greatly enhances the public administration efficiency. In this case, the focal point will revolve around the matter of attaining effective control over decisions carried out by AI, as well as the prescribed boundaries of its capabilities within the legal domain, as established by legislative measures.","2024","2024-11-03 11:44:44","2024-11-03 11:44:44","","516-526","","2","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001288915700014","","","","","","","artificial intelligence; digitalization; law enforcement; law-making; legal consciousness.; legal norm; subject of law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In accomplishing such tasks, they may intentionally commit 'AI crimes', ie engage in behaviour which would be considered a crime if it were accomplished by humans. For instance, an advanced AI trading agent may-despite its designer's best efforts-autonomously manipulate markets while lacking the properties for being held criminally responsible. In such cases (hard AI crimes) a criminal responsibility gap emerges since no agent (human or artificial) can be legitimately punished for this outcome. We aim to shift the 'hard AI crime' discussion from blame to deterrence and design an 'AI deterrence paradigm', separate from criminal law and inspired by the economic theory of crime. The homo economicus has come to life as a machina economica, which, even if cannot be meaningfully blamed, can nevertheless be effectively deterred since it internalises criminal sanctions as costs.","2024-05-07","2024-11-03 11:44:44","2024-11-03 11:44:44","","673-701","","3","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001215165200001","","","","","","","LAW; artificial intelligence; criminal law; deterrence; law and economics; legal theory; responsibility; ROBOTS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To advance sentence simplification and document simplification in German, this paper presents DEPLAIN, a new dataset of parallel, professionally written and manually aligned simplifications in plain German (""plain DE"" or in German: 'Einfache Sprache""). DEPLAIN consists of a newsdomain (approx. 500 document pairs, approx. 13k sentence pairs) and a web-domain corpus (approx. 150 aligned documents, approx. 2k aligned sentence pairs). In addition, we are building a web harvester and experimenting with automatic alignment methods to facilitate the integration of non-aligned and to be published parallel documents. Using this approach, we are dynamically increasing the webdomain corpus, so it is currently extended to approx. 750 document pairs and approx. 3.5k aligned sentence pairs.

Lately, the use of ADM systems across various fields, ranging from public to private, from criminal justice to credit scoring, has given rise to concerns about the negative consequences that data-driven technologies have in reinforcing and reinterpreting existing societal biases. This development has led to growing demand for ethical AI, often perceived to require human control over automation. By engaging in discussions of human-computer interaction and in post-structural policy analysis, I examine EU policy proposals to address the problematizations of AI through human oversight. I argue that the relevant policy documents do not reflect the results of earlier research which have undeniably demonstrated the shortcomings of human control over automation, which in turn leads to the reproduction of the harmful dichotomy of human versus machine in EU policy. Despite its shortcomings, the emphasis on human oversight reflects broader fears surrounding loss of control, framed as ethical concerns around digital technologies. Critical examination of these fears reveals an inherent connection between human agency and the legitimacy of legal decision-making that socio-legal scholarship needs to address.","2020","2024-11-03 11:45:24","2024-11-03 11:45:24","","9-46","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000567158400002","","","","","","","AI ethics; legal theory; oversight; automation; algorithmic governance; EU law; human control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Part II describes how AI is transforming what it means to provide legal services in six primary areas: litigation review; expertise automation; legal research; contract analytics; contract and litigation document generation; and predictive analytics. Part III explores who are the providers of these AI driven legal services - often non-lawyer legal service providers - and how these providers are replacing at least some of what clients have traditionally sought from lawyers. Part III also discusses the implications of all these changes both for the future role of lawyers individually, and in particular what services will clients still need lawyers to perform: judgment, empathy, creativity and adaptability. In turn, this Part examines what will these changes mean for the size, shape, composition and economic model of law firms, as well as the implications of these changes for legal education and lawyer training. Part IV identifies the principal legal, ethical, regulatory and risk management issues raised by the use of AI in the provision of legal services.

It deals with two relevant EU regulations, namely the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the proposed European AI regulation (AI Act), emphasizing the need for more clarity and protection for taxpayers. The GDPR imposes a principled ban on fully automated decisions but allows exceptions if appropriate measures are in place. The AI Act introduces a right to human intervention for high-risk AI systems, but the author argues that the regulations are not clear enough, especially in view of the upcoming 'tax administration 3.0' model of the OECD further reducing human intervention.

These developments confront us with the following interrelated questions: can algorithmic public decisions be truly 'public'? And, to what extent does the use of ML models compromise the 'publicness' of such decisions? This article is part of a broader inquiry into the myriad ways in which digital and AI technologies transform the fabric of our democratic existence by mutating the 'public'. Focusing on the site of public administration, the article develops a conception of publicness that is grounded in a view of public administrations as communities of practice. These communities operate through dialogical, critical and synergetic interactions that allow them to track-as faithfully as possible-the public's heterogeneous view of its interests, and reify these interests in decision making. Building on this theorisation, the article suggests that the use of ML models in public decision making inevitably generates an impoverished publicness, and thus undermines the potential of public administrations to operate as a locus of democratic construction. The article thus advocates for a reconsideration of the ways in which administrative law problematises and addresses the harms of algorithmic decision making.","2024-08-10","2024-11-03 11:45:26","2024-11-03 11:45:26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001288229000001","","","","","","","LAW; machine learning; artificial intelligence; administrative law; AUTOMATION; BIAS; public administration; TRANSPARENCY; law & technology; PREDICTION; public decision making","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet judges are confronting machine learning algorithms with increasing frequency, including in criminal, administrative, and civil cases. This Essay argues that judges should demand explanations for these algorithmic outcomes. One way to address the ""black box"" problem is to design systems that explain how the algorithms reach their conclusions or predic lions. If and as judges demand these explanations, they will play a seminal role in shaping the nature and form of ""explainable AI"" (xAI). Using the tools of the common law, courts can develop what xAI should mean in different legal contexts. There are advantages to having courts to play this role: Judicial reasoning that builds from the bottom up, using case-by-case consideration of the facts to produce nuanced decisions, is a pragmatic way to develop rules for xAI. Further, courts are likely to stimulate the production of different forms of xAI that are responsive to distinct legal settings and audiences. More generally, we should favor the greater involvement of public actors in shaping xAI, which to date has largely been left in private hands.","2019-11","2024-11-03 11:45:26","2024-11-03 11:45:26","","1829-1850","","7","119","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000505471500006","","","","","","","AUTOMATION; EXPLANATION; DECISION-MAKING; BIAS; COMMON-LAW","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the legal domain and identifying appropriate citation context or cite-worthy sentences automatically is challenging. Our research is centered on the issue of citation-worthiness identification of a given sentence. This serves as the initial phase in contemporary citation recommendation systems, aimed at alleviating the effort involved in extracting a suitable array of citation contexts. To address this, we first introduce a labeled dataset comprising 178 million sentences, specifically tailored for detecting citation-worthy content within the legal domain. This dataset is curated from the Caselaw Access Project (CAP)(2) (https://case.law/). We proceeded to assess the performance of a range of deep learning models on this novel dataset. Among the models examined, the domain-specific pre-trained model consistently demonstrated superior performance, achieving an 88% F1-score in the task of detecting citation-worthy material.

Situating these considerations within the broader commentary regarding the future of work and the role of human beings in an age of automation, this article argues that the nature and type of skills taught to future lawyers, as well as the substantive knowledge relevant in the 21st century, will depend upon the irreducible value of human beings to the law and legal processes. Tasks that require creativity, complex reasoning or social intelligence (such as the ability to negotiate complex social relationships effectively) will remain the province of human beings. This must inform and shape legal education. Consequently, this article argues that the future of legal education is one that recognises lawyers will increasingly be required to attain a broad, liberal education enabling interdisciplinary insights, creativity and social intelligence.","2020","2024-11-03 11:45:26","2024-11-03 11:45:26","","243-265","","1","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000558661200008","","","","","","","AGE; MOOCS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
