AB  - In view of the frequent occurrence of marine accidents and the complex interaction of various risk-influencing factors (RIFs), a data-driven method to risk analysis that combines association rule mining (ARM) and complex network (CN) analysis is proposed in this study. The efficient FP-Growth algorithm is applied to facilitate ARM to examine risk patterns that frequently occur in marine accidents. Subsequently, CN theory is employed to scrutinise the multifaceted role of various RIFs and their interactions in the complex marine accident system, which involves the basic characteristics of the network, the identification of key RIFs through the application of the weighted LeaderRank (WLR) algorithm, and a robustness analysis. The results of the study indicate that compared with random networks, marine accident networks exhibit a higher level of complexity, which brings challenges to safety prevention and control. Inadequate regulation, violations, and deficiencies in safety management systems are identified as key RIFs, stressing the urgency of improving supervision, strengthening law enforcement and strengthening the safety management system. This study may facilitate maritime safety management of maritime traffic and the development of risk analysis methods.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being deployed in crucial missions for the armed forces, law enforcement, industrial control monitoring, and other sectors. However, these hostile operating circumstances, along with the UAVs' dependence on wireless protocols, pose substantial security threats, limiting their mainstream application. With network security being such a major issue for UAV networks, the machine learning-based intrusion detection system (IDS) has been determined to be an effective strategy for protecting them. Additionally, though the existing methods offer effective strategies for detecting and categorizing abnormalities in the system, they are limited by their inability to adjust to various attack patterns. The dataset used as well as the memory and computational requirement of existing models, poses new challenges. One of the main concerns pertains to the reduced computational and memory demands of these models. So, the work carried out in this paper addresses this challenge. A new dimensional reduction technique based on correlation coefficient, information gain, and principal component analysis (PCA) is introduced to reduce the dimensionality of the UAV Attack Dataset. A novel intrusion detection system based on an artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA) is then proposed. The genetic algorithm is used to generate the optimal weights of the artificial neural network. A comparison is made between the proposed model and the backpropagation network and its variant in terms of its convergence and prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed model is compared with that of other classifiers. This comparison reveals that the proposed model is time efficient with an increased prediction accuracy of at least 6% more than other classifiers.

KW  - Machine learning
AB  - One of the main challenges in screening of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques is the class imbalance problem, where the number of different EOR techniques is not equal. This problem hinders the generalization of the data-driven methods used to predict suitable EOR techniques for candidate reservoirs. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a novel approach to overcome the above challenge by taking advantage of the Power-Law Committee Machine (PLCM) technique optimized by Particle Swam Optimization (PSO) to combine the output of five cutting-edge machine learning methods with different types of learning algorithms. The PLCM method has not been used in previous studies for EOR screening. The machine learning models include the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), CatBoost, Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The CatBoost is used for the first time in this work for screening of EOR methods. The role of the PSO is to find the optimal values for the coefficients and exponents of the power-law model. In this study, a bigger dataset than those in previous studies, including 2563 successful worldwide EOR experiences, was gathered. A bigger dataset improves the generalization of the data-driven methods and prevents overfitting. The hyperparameters of the individual machine-learning models were tuned using the fivefold cross-validation technique. The results showed that all the individual methods could predict the suitable EOR method for unseen cases with an average score of 0.868. Among the machine learning models, the KNN and SVM had the highest scores with a value of 0.894 and 0.892, respectively. Nonetheless, after combining the output of the models using the PLCM method, the score of the predictions improved to 0.963, which was a substantial increase. Finally, a feature importance analysis was conducted to find out the most influential parameters on the output. The novelty of this work is having shown the ability of the PLCM technique to construct an accurate model to overcome the class-imbalance issue in EOR screening by utilizing different types of data-driven models. According to feature importance analysis, oil gravity and formation porosity were recognized as the most influential parameters on EOR screening.

AB  - Perhaps the most widely touted of GPT-4's at-launch, zero-shot capabilities has been its reported 90th-percentile performance on the Uniform Bar Exam. This paper begins by investigating the methodological challenges in documenting and verifying the 90th-percentile claim, presenting four sets of findings that indicate that OpenAI's estimates of GPT-4's UBE percentile are overinflated. First, although GPT-4's UBE score nears the 90th percentile when examining approximate conversions from February administrations of the Illinois Bar Exam, these estimates are heavily skewed towards repeat test-takers who failed the July administration and score significantly lower than the general test-taking population. Second, data from a recent July administration of the same exam suggests GPT-4's overall UBE percentile was below the 69th percentile, and similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 48th percentile on essays. Third, examining official NCBE data and using several conservative statistical assumptions, GPT-4's performance against first-time test takers is estimated to be similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 62nd percentile, including similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 42nd percentile on essays. Fourth, when examining only those who passed the exam (i.e. licensed or license-pending attorneys), GPT-4's performance is estimated to drop to similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 48th percentile overall, and similar to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sim$$\end{document} 15th percentile on essays. In addition to investigating the validity of the percentile claim, the paper also investigates the validity of GPT-4's reported scaled UBE score of 298. The paper successfully replicates the MBE score, but highlights several methodological issues in the grading of the MPT + MEE components of the exam, which call into question the validity of the reported essay score. Finally, the paper investigates the effect of different hyperparameter combinations on GPT-4's MBE performance, finding no significant effect of adjusting temperature settings, and a significant effect of few-shot chain-of-thought prompting over basic zero-shot prompting. Taken together, these findings carry timely insights for the desirability and feasibility of outsourcing legally relevant tasks to AI models, as well as for the importance for AI developers to implement rigorous and transparent capabilities evaluations to help secure safe and trustworthy AI.

AB  - Utilization of the Internet in our everyday lives has made us vulnerable in terms of privacy and security of our data and systems. Therefore, there is a pressing need to protect our data and systems by improving authentication mechanisms, which are expected to be low cost, unobtrusive, and ideally ubiquitous in nature. Behavioral biometric modalities such as mouse dynamics (mouse behaviors on a graphical user interface (GUI)) and widget interactions (another modality closely related to mouse dynamics that also considers the target (widget) of a GUI interaction, such as links, buttons, and combo-boxes) can bolster the security of existing authentication systems because of their ability to distinguish individuals based on their unique features. As a result, it can be difficult for an imposter to impersonate these behavioral biometrics, making them suitable for authentication. In this article, we survey the literature on mouse dynamics and widget interactions dated from 1897 to 2023. We begin our survey with an account of the psychological perspectives on behavioral biometrics. We then analyze the literature along the following dimensions: tasks and experimental settings for data collection, taxonomy of raw attributes, feature extractions and mathematical definitions, publicly available datasets, algorithms (statistical, machine learning, and deep learning), data fusion, performance, and limitations. We end the paper with presenting challenges and promising research opportunities.

KW  - MODELS
AB  - Ensuring the long-term chemical durability of glasses is critical for nuclear waste immobilization operations. Durable glasses usually undergo qualification for disposal based on their response to standardized tests such as the product consistency test or the vapor hydration test (VHT). The VHT uses elevated temperature and water vapor to accelerate glass alteration and the formation of secondary phases. Understanding the relationship between glass composition and VHT response is of fundamental and practical interest. However, this relationship is complex, non-linear, and sometimes fairly variable, posing challenges in identifying the distinct effect of individual oxides on VHT response. Here, we leverage a dataset comprising 654 Hanford low-activity waste (LAW) glasses across a wide compositional envelope and employ various machine learning techniques to explore this relationship. We find that Gaussian process regression (GPR), a nonparametric regression method, yields the highest predictive accuracy. By utilizing the trained model, we discern the influence of each oxide on the glasses' VHT response. Moreover, we discuss the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting for extrapolating the material performance in the context of sparse and heterogeneous datasets.

AB  - Machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI), relies on large corpora of data as input for learning algorithms, resulting in trained models that can perform a variety of tasks. While data or information are not subject matter within copyright law, almost all materials used to construct corpora for machine learning are protected by copyright law: texts, images, videos, and so on. There are global policy moves to address the copyright implications of machine learning, in particular in the context of so-called "foundation models" that underpin generative AI. This paper takes a step back, exploring empirically three technological settings through detailed case studies. We set out the established industry methodology of a lifecycle of AI (collecting data, organising data, model training, model operation) to arrive at descriptions suitable for legal analysis. This will allow an assessment of the challenges for a harmonisation of rights, exceptions and disclosure under EU copyright law. The three case studies are:Machine learning for scientific purposes, in the context of a study of regional short-term letting markets;Natural Language Processing (NLP), in the context of large language models;Computer vision, in the context of content moderation of images.We find that the nature and quality of data corpora at the input stage is central to the lifecycle of machine learning. Because of the uncertain legal status of data collection and processing, combined with the competitive advantage gained by firms not disclosing technological advances, the inputs of the models deployed are often unknown. Moreover, the "lawful access" requirement of the EU exception for text and data mining may turn the exception into a decision by rightholders to allow machine learning in the context of their decision to allow access. We assess policy interventions at EU level, seeking to clarify the legal status of input data via copyright exceptions, opt-outs or the forced disclosure of copyright materials. We find that the likely result is a fully copyright-licensed environment of machine learning that may have problematic effects for the structure of industry, innovation and scientific research.

AB  - Reflecting the recent slow-down in Moore's law and the proliferation of artificial intelligence/machine learning workloads, the performance and energy consumption of networks are becoming barriers in high-performance computing (HPC) and data centers. Optical switches are expected to break these barriers, and indeed their introduction has recently commenced in data centers. This paper discusses how optical switching technologies can innovate future intra data center networks. Hyperscale data centers are much bigger in scale, and network requirements are slightly different from those of HPC. This paper focus on data center networks, since the impact of optical technologies will be more significant in data centers than in HPC. In addition to the scale issue, important metrics to be considered for network design are traffic characteristics and latency, both of which are highlighted in this paper. For hybrid (electrical packet and optical circuit) switching networks, the target latency for the optical circuit switch network (connection setup/teardown time) is shown to be around 10 mu s, and the needed technologies are clarified and verified by experiments. The optical switch can simplify the present multi-tier switching network above tier-1 switches into a single tier configuration, which is possible with the development of efficient large port count optical switches. Among the different switching architectures, combining the different dimensions of space and wavelength is shown to be one of the best solutions. Fast switching needs fast device response time. Si photonics devices using Mach-Zehnder interferometers or ring-resonator-based switches and tunable filters are the most promising candidates; they offer cost-effective mass-production and fast operation and so are excellent candidates for the optical switches envisaged. Another critical technology to maximize the benefits of optical switches is a simple and low-latency control mechanism. Different approaches have been suggested as summarized in this work. Among them, harnessing optical switch parallelism is a unique technique that matches recent advances in electrical switch chips. A fast control network is realized by using a fully decentralized and asynchronous control mechanism. A hyperscale data center offers a wide variety of services, and no one system fits all needs. Optimization of parameters is an important task for maximizing the impact of optical switching in different kinds of data centers.

AB  - Context. Large-scale sky surveys at low frequencies, such as the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), allow for the detection and characterisation of unprecedented numbers of giant radio galaxies (GRGs, or "giants", of at least lp, GRG := 0.7 Mpc long). This, in turn, enables us to study giants in a cosmological context. A tantalising prospect of such studies is a measurement of the contribution of giants to cosmic magnetogenesis. However, this measurement requires en masse radio-optical association for well-resolved radio galaxies and a statistical framework to infer GRG population properties. Aims. By automating the creation of radio-optical catalogues, we aim to significantly expand the census of known giants. With the resulting sample and a forward model that takes into account selection effects, we aim to constrain their intrinsic length distribution, number density, and lobe volume-filling fraction (VFF) in the Cosmic Web. Methods. We combined five existing codes into a single machine learning (ML)-driven pipeline that automates radio source component association and optical host identification for well-resolved radio sources. We created a radio-optical catalogue for the entire LoTSS Data Release 2 (DR2) footprint and subsequently selected all sources that qualify as possible giants. We combined the list of ML pipeline GRG candidates with an existing list of LoTSS DR2 crowd-sourced GRG candidates and visually confirmed or rejected all members of the merged sample. To infer intrinsic GRG properties from GRG observations, we developed further a population-based forward model and constrained its parameters using Bayesian inference. Results. Roughly half of all GRG candidates that our ML pipeline identifies indeed turn out to be giants upon visual inspection, whereas the success rate is 1 in 11 for the previous best giant-finding ML technique in the literature. We confirm 5576 previously unknown giants from the crowd-sourced LoTSS DR2 catalogue and 2566 previously unknown giants from the ML pipeline. Our confirmations and discoveries bring the total number of known giants to at least 11 485. Our intrinsic GRG population forward model provides a good fit to the data. The posterior indicates that the projected lengths of giants are consistent with a curved power law probability density function whose initial tail index xi(l(p,GRG)) = - 2.8 +/- 0.2 changes by Delta xi = -2.4 +/- 0.3 over the interval up to l(p) = 5 Mpc. We predict a comoving GRG number density n(GRG) = 13 +/- 10 (100 Mpc)(-3), close to a recent estimate of the number density of luminous non-giant radio galaxies. With the projected length distribution, number density, and additional assumptions, we derive a present-day GRG lobe VFF VGRG-CW(z = 0) = 1.4 +/- 1.1 x 10(-5) in clusters and filaments of the Cosmic Web. Conclusions. We present a state-of-the-art ML-accelerated pipeline for finding giants, whose complex morphologies, arcminute extents, and radio-emitting surroundings pose challenges. Our data analysis suggests that giants are more common than previously thought. More work is needed to make GRG lobe VFF estimates reliable, but tentative results imply that it is possible that magnetic fields once contained in giants pervade a significant (greater than or similar to 10%) fraction of today's Cosmic Web.
