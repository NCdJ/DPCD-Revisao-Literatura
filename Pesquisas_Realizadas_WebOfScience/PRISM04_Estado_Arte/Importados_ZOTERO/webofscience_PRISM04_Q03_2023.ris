KW  - text and data mining
AB  - The European Union (EU) text and data mining (TDM) provisions are a progressive move, but the horizon is still uncertain for both generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models researchers and developers. This article suggests that to drive innovation and further the commitment to the digital single market, during the national implementation, EU Member States could consider taking the Japanese broad, all-encompassing and "nonenjoyment-based" TDM as an example. The Japanese "nonenjoyment" purposes, however, are not foreign to the European continental view of copyright. A similar concept can be found under the German concept of "Freier Werkgenuss" or enjoyment of the work. A flexible TDM exception built upon the German notion of nonenjoyment purposes could become an opening clause to foster innovation and creativity in the age of GenAI. Moreover, the article argues that an opening clause allowing TDM with "nonenjoyment" purposes could be permissible under the so-called three-step test. This article further suggests, if there is no political will to safeguard "the right to read should be the right to mine" and to provide a welcoming environment for GenAI researchers and developers, when shaping the legal interpretation through national case law, the EU Member States could consider the following: (1) advocate for 72 h of response if technological protection measures (TPMs) are preventing TDM, and (2) Robot Exclusion Standard (robot.txt) as a warning when TDM is not allowed on a website. It is now in the hands of the EU Member States, whether to protect the interests of rightholders or to create a balance between safeguarding "the right to read should be the right to mine," protecting rightholders exclusivity, and creating a supportive environment for the GenAI models researcher and developers.

TI  - Attribution problem of generative AI: a view from US copyright law
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW & PRACTICE
LA  - English
KW  - PROPERTY
AB  - center dot Three significant lawsuits concerning generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) were filed in the USA, starting the first wave of lawsuits against AI: (i) coders filed claims for the alleged use of their codes by OpenAI's CoPilot, (ii) visual artists filed claims against companies using Stable Diffusion and (iii) Getty Images filed claims against Stability AI, which uses Stable Diffusion. Following the lead of these lawsuits, copyright owners of literary works filed four other lawsuits against OpenAI, Meta and Alphabet (Google)'s large language models. All of these lawsuits are pending at the time of writing.
   center dot Among other things, plaintiffs filed claims challenging generative AI's lack of attribution to copyright owners of in-copyright works in its training data. As US copyright law does not protect moral rights strongly, a federal rule granting a right of attribution to all copyright owners does not exist. Yet, there are some provisions providing quasi-protection. Section 1202 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is one of them and protects copyright owners against removal/modification of the Copyright Management Information in connection with their works.
   center dot This article lays down the limitations of moral rights protection in the USA and demonstrates the difficulties faced by the plaintiffs of the pending lawsuits. The limitations of Section 1202 DMCA are explained to demonstrate its difference from a classic moral right of attribution. The outcomes of these lawsuits will be significant in building case law on generative AI for the first time in the USA. This article evaluates the benefits and disadvantages of courts' possible acceptance of plaintiffs' claims regarding attribution.

TI  - "It's Like I've Got This Music in My Mind":1 Protecting Human Authorship in the Age of Generative Artificial Intelligence
T2  - HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - The music industry stands on the brink of a crisis. With unpredictable judicial standards that are inconsistent across the country, plaintiffs seeking to protect their musical works against copyright infringement face a heavy burden of proof, especially when facing defendants who are more wellknown and more well-funded. Not only that, but plaintiffs may not receive their day in court given that powerhouse artists like Taylor Swift, Sam Smith, and Bruno Mars have chosen to settle rather than defend their musical works in court. Now, Generative Artificial Intelligence ("Generative A.I.") and A.I.-generated music will inevitably send the music industry into a tailspin-and the law is not ready to grapple with the complexities that will arise. To wit, Generative A.I. is poised to threaten the very principles on which copyright law is founded: To encourage (human) creativity by protecting original works of expression. This Note seeks to protect human music copyright holders against the ever-growing threat of A.I.-generated music. Part I addresses A.I. technology and the legal uncertainties associated with A.I.-generated music. Part II discusses the current doctrine of music copyright infringement. Part III offers a series of proposals for how to adapt the current doctrine to ensure music copyright holders can protect their original works of human authorship against A.I.-generated works.

AB  - From the perspective of a descriptive analysis, and as a starting point to a new research line, this paper examines the potential impact Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) technologies may have on academic integrity, manifested in the learning and evaluation processes of law classes at the university level. The article takes as its premise the definition of academic integrity as a set of values and argues that a series of risks arise from the GAI that threaten those values, such as excessive dependence and trust in the GAI, the unreallizability of the pedagogical project and the loss of competitiveness of educational institutions, among others. To minimize or nullify such risks, and thus prevent them from affecting academic integrity, four mitigation measures are identified to be applied in university environments.

AB  - We are witnessing an accelerated technological evolution that has enabled the development of artificial intelligence in various fields, allowing it to gradually infiltrate the entire society. We intend to cover only a small subset of AI technologies in our paper, that of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). Our objectives are to shed light on the legal issues that GenAI can cause and to find solutions to them. We begin with a definition of GenAI in the much broader context of AI technologies. Answers to a few essential questions are to be found: 'How does GenAI work?', 'What could GenAI be used for?', 'What legal issues could arise from using a GenAI?'. To accomplish our goals, we first conduct a literature review to define artificial intelligence (AI) in general and GenAI in particular. Several lawsuits are chosen to illustrate the magnitude of the legal problems and to test the feasibility of possible solutions in both the national and EU legal systems. Then, we analyse GenAI's output, liability for its contents and for its use, altogether with examples of related contractual clauses.

AB  - A large law firm typically exhibits a collective intelligence comprised of hundreds or thousands of legal minds aimed at simultaneously engaging thousands of active matters across scores of industries and dozens of practice specialties with distinct doctrinal and procedural characteristics. The firm is challenged not only to achieve successful, cost-effective outcomes for its clients, but must also simultaneously, in competition with other firms and alternative service providers, attract and cultivate talent, develop and coordinate capabilities across multiple evolving areas of practice and continually improve a robust collective intelligence to gain a competitive edge. As various types of machine intelligences and tools are introduced, firms must also groom these into the collective. In this paper we explore a human-machine hybrid system for addressing this large scale, multi-dimensional, dynamic optimization challenge to coordinate a collective intelligence of humans and machines. Machine intelligence is needed to handle the computational complexity and it is complemented by human intelligence to help handle exceptions and novel situations. We believe this approach has potential for transforming the collective intelligence that is the large law firm.

AB  - Since the beginning of 2023, generative artificial intelligence (hereinafter "Generative AI") in the form of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-4 has taken the world by storm. Legal practice is no exception. Among other stories, worldwide headlines have featured the fact that ChatGPT-4 is capable of passing the New York Bar Exam, that courts are adopting Generative AI in their decision-making, and that a New York lawyer has been sanctioned by a judge for relying upon non-existent case law precedent that he obtained from ChatGPT-4 and did not double-check.
   Yet, putting aside these newsworthy developments, tools powered by other forms of artificial intelligence (hereinafter "AI") have already been relied upon in legal practice for many years. This article introduces how AI supports successful international arbitration practice, including uses and methods that are already available and those that are anticipated to become helpful. This article also addresses the challenges and pitfalls that accompany these opportunities. Overall, this article concludes that the brave new world of AI in international arbitration is an exciting one that, through careful and thoughtful deployment of best practices, can add significant value to international arbitration teams in the decades to come.

As different jurisdictions are in the process of "catching up" to the technology, this paper argues that compulsory mediation, as an alternate dispute resolution, has the potential to address legal uncertainties. The flexible and informal nature of the compulsory mediation process makes a suitable environment for all stakeholders involved, the right owners, the creators, and the users of the AI, to come to an agreement, thus lessening the impact such new invention brings to domestic legal framework. Moreover, by looking into compulsory mediations in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Turkey, this paper hopes to outline key factors for compulsory mediation to properly tackle the subject of intellectual property disputes of AI nature.
