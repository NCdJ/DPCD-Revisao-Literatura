AB  - Over the last decade, technological advancements, especially artificial intelligence (AI), have significantly transformed educational practices. Recently, the development and adoption of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), particularly OpenAI's ChatGPT, has sparked considerable interest. The unprecedented capabilities of these models, such as generating humanlike text and facilitating automated conversations, have broad implications in various sectors, including education and health. Despite their immense potential, concerns regarding their widespread use and opacity have been raised within the scientific community. ChatGPT, the latest version of the GPT series, has displayed remarkable proficiency, passed the US bar law exam, and amassed over a million subscribers shortly after its launch. However, its impact on the education sector has elicited mixed reactions, with some educators heralding it as a progressive step and others raising alarms over its potential to reduce analytical skills and promote misconduct. This paper aims to delve into these discussions, exploring the potential and problems associated with applying advanced AI models in education. It builds on extant literature and contributes to understanding how these technologies reshape educational norms in the "new AI gold rush" era.

AB  - Connecting Vision and Language plays an essential role in Generative Intelligence. For this reason, large research efforts have been devoted to image captioning, i.e. describing images with syntactically and semantically meaningful sentences. Starting from 2015 the task has generally been addressed with pipelines composed of a visual encoder and a language model for text generation. During these years, both components have evolved considerably through the exploitation of object regions, attributes, the introduction of multi-modal connections, fully-attentive approaches, and BERT-like early-fusion strategies. However, regardless of the impressive results, research in image captioning has not reached a conclusive answer yet. This work aims at providing a comprehensive overview of image captioning approaches, from visual encoding and text generation to training strategies, datasets, and evaluation metrics. In this respect, we quantitatively compare many relevant state-of-the-art approaches to identify the most impactful technical innovations in architectures and training strategies. Moreover, many variants of the problem and its open challenges are discussed. The final goal of this work is to serve as a tool for understanding the existing literature and highlighting the future directions for a research area where Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing can find an optimal synergy.

AB  - Large generative AI models (LGAIMs), such as ChatGPT, GPT-4 or Stable Diffusion, are rapidly transforming the way we communicate, illustrate, and create. However, AI regulation, in the EU and beyond, has primarily focused on conventional AI models, not LGAIMs. This paper will situate these new generative models in the current debate on trustworthy AI regulation, and ask how the law can be tailored to their capabilities. After laying technical foundations, the legal part of the paper proceeds in four steps, covering (1) direct regulation, (2) data protection, (3) content moderation, and (4) policy proposals. It suggests a novel terminology to capture the AI value chain in LGAIM settings by differentiating between LGAIM developers, deployers, professional and non-professional users, as well as recipients of LGAIM output. We tailor regulatory duties to these different actors along the value chain and suggest strategies to ensure that LGAIMs are trustworthy and deployed for the benefit of society at large. Rules in the AI Act and other direct regulation must match the specificities of pre-trained models. The paper argues for three layers of obligations concerning LGAIMs (minimum standards for all LGAIMs; high-risk obligations for high-risk use cases; collaborations along the AI value chain). In general, regulation should focus on concrete high-risk applications, and not the pre-trained model itself, and should include (i) obligations regarding transparency and (ii) risk management. Non-discrimination provisions (iii) may, however, apply to LGAIM developers. Lastly, (iv) the core of the DSA's content moderation rules should be expanded to cover LGAIMs. This includes notice and action mechanisms, and trusted flaggers.

AB  - Educational technology innovations leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown the potential to automate the laborious process of generating and analysing textual content. While various innovations have been developed to automate a range of educational tasks (eg, question generation, feedback provision, and essay grading), there are concerns regarding the practicality and ethicality of these innovations. Such concerns may hinder future research and the adoption of LLMs-based innovations in authentic educational contexts. To address this, we conducted a systematic scoping review of 118 peer-reviewed papers published since 2017 to pinpoint the current state of research on using LLMs to automate and support educational tasks. The findings revealed 53 use cases for LLMs in automating education tasks, categorised into nine main categories: profiling/labelling, detection, grading, teaching support, prediction, knowledge representation, feedback, content generation, and recommendation. Additionally, we also identified several practical and ethical challenges, including low technological readiness, lack of replicability and transparency and insufficient privacy and beneficence considerations. The findings were summarised into three recommendations for future studies, including updating existing innovations with state-of-the-art models (eg, GPT-3/4), embracing the initiative of open-sourcing models/systems, and adopting a human-centred approach throughout the developmental process. As the intersection of AI and education is continuously evolving, the findings of this study can serve as an essential reference point for researchers, allowing them to leverage the strengths, learn from the limitations, and uncover potential research opportunities enabled by ChatGPT and other generative AI models.

AB  - In the field of natural language processing (NLP), there have been various pre-training language models in recent years, with question answering systems gaining significant attention. However, as algorithms, data, and computing power advance, the issue of increasingly larger models and a growing number of parameters has surfaced. Consequently, model training has become more costly and less efficient. To enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the training process while reducing the model volume, this paper proposes a first-order pruning model PAL-BERT based on the ALBERT model according to the characteristics of question-answering (QA) system and language model. Firstly, a first-order network pruning method based on the ALBERT model is designed, and the PAL-BERT model is formed. Then, the parameter optimization strategy of the PAL-BERT model is formulated, and the Mish function was used as an activation function instead of ReLU to improve the performance. Finally, after comparison experiments with traditional deep learning models TextCNN and BiLSTM, it is confirmed that PALBERT is a pruning model compression method that can significantly reduce training time and optimize training efficiency. Compared with traditional models, PAL-BERT significantly improves the NLP task's performance.

AB  - ImportanceChat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) has shown promising performance in various fields, including medicine, business, and law, but its accuracy in specialty-specific medical questions, particularly in ophthalmology, is still uncertain.PurposeThis study evaluates the performance of two ChatGPT models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and human professionals in answering ophthalmology questions from the StatPearls question bank, assessing their outcomes, and providing insights into the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in ophthalmology.MethodsChatGPT's performance was evaluated using 467 ophthalmology questions from the StatPearls question bank. These questions were stratified into 11 subcategories, four difficulty levels, and three generalized anatomical categories. The answer accuracy of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and human participants was assessed. Statistical analysis was conducted via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the statistical significance of GPT-3 versus GPT-4 versus human performance, and repeated unpaired two-sample t-tests to compare the means of two groups. ResultsGPT-4 outperformed both GPT-3.5 and human professionals on ophthalmology StatPearls questions, except in the "Lens and Cataract" category. The performance differences were statistically significant overall, with GPT-4 achieving higher accuracy (73.2%) compared to GPT-3.5 (55.5%, p-value < 0.001) and humans (58.3%, p-value < 0.001). There were variations in performance across difficulty levels (rated one to four), but GPT-4 consistently performed better than both GPT-3.5 and humans on level-two,-three, and-four questions. On questions of level-four difficulty, human performance significantly exceeded that of GPT-3.5 (p = 0.008).ConclusionThe study's findings demonstrate GPT-4's significant performance improvements over GPT-3.5 and human professionals on StatPearls ophthalmology questions. Our results highlight the potential of advanced conversational AI systems to be utilized as important tools in the education and practice of medicine.

AB  - Sentiment analysis has been widely used in microblogging sites such as Twitter in recent decades, where millions of users express their opinions and thoughts because of its short and simple manner of expression. Several studies reveal the state of sentiment which does not express sentiment based on the user context because of different lengths and ambiguous emotional information. Hence, this study proposes text classification with the use of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) for natural language processing with other variants. The experimental findings demonstrate that the combination of BERT with CNN, BERT with RNN, and BERT with BiLSTM performs well in terms of accuracy rate, precision rate, recall rate, and F1-score compared to when it was used with Word2vec and when it was used with no variant.

AB  - Inflammation is a biologically resistant response to harmful stimuli, such as infection, damaged cells, toxic chemicals, or tissue injuries. Its purpose is to eradicate pathogenic micro-organisms or irritants and facilitate tissue repair. Prolonged inflammation can result in chronic inflammatory diseases. However, wet-laboratory-based treatments are costly and time-consuming and may have adverse side effects on normal cells. In the past decade, peptide therapeutics have gained significant attention due to their high specificity in targeting affected cells without affecting healthy cells. Motivated by the significance of peptide-based therapies, we developed a highly discriminative prediction model called AIPs-SnTCN to predict anti-inflammatory peptides accurately. The peptide samples are encoded using word embedding techniques such as skip-gram and attention-based bidirectional encoder representation using a transformer (BERT). The conjoint triad feature (CTF) also collects structure-based cluster profile features. The fused vector of word embedding and sequential features is formed to compensate for the limitations of single encoding methods. Support vector machine-based recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) is applied to choose the ranking-based optimal space. The optimized feature space is trained by using an improved self-normalized temporal convolutional network (SnTCN). The AIPs-SnTCN model achieved a predictive accuracy of 95.86% and an AUC of 0.97 by using training samples. In the case of the alternate training data set, our model obtained an accuracy of 92.04% and an AUC of 0.96. The proposed AIPs-SnTCN model outperformed existing models with an similar to 19% higher accuracy and an similar to 14% higher AUC value. The reliability and efficacy of our AIPs-SnTCN model make it a valuable tool for scientists and may play a beneficial role in pharmaceutical design and research academia.
