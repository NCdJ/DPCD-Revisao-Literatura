AB  - Legal-BERT models are based on the BERT architecture (or its variants) and have been developed specifically for the legal domain. They have reached the state of the art in complex legal tasks such as legal research, document synthesis, contract analysis, argument extraction, and legal prediction. In this paper, we proposed four versions of Legal-BERT models pre-trained on the Italian legal domain. They aim to improve NLP applications in the Italian legal context. We have shown that they outperforms the Italian "generalpurpose" BERT in several domain-specific tasks, such as named entity recognition, sentence classification, semantic similarity with Bi-encoders, and document classification.

AB  - Legal text is significantly different from English text (e.g. Wikipedia, News) used for training most natural language processing (NLP) algorithms. As a result, the state of the art algorithms (e.g. GPT3, BERT derivatives), need additional effort (e.g. fine-tuning and further pre-training) to achieve optimal performance on legal text. Hence there is a need to create separate NLP data sets and benchmarks for legal text which are challenging and focus on tasks specific to legal systems. This will spur innovation in applications of NLP for legal text and will benefit AI community and legal fraternity. This paper focuses on an empirical review of the existing work in the use of NLP in Indian legal text and proposes ideas to create new benchmarks for Indian Legal NLP.

AB  - Complex legal language, filled with jargon, nuanced language semantics, and a high level of domain specificity, poses a significant challenge for automation in handling various legal tasks. In the realm of legal document composition, a pivotal component revolves around accurately referencing case laws and other sources to substantiate assertions and arguments. Understanding the legal domain and identifying appropriate citation context or cite-worthy sentences automatically is challenging. Our research is centered on the issue of citation-worthiness identification of a given sentence. This serves as the initial phase in contemporary citation recommendation systems, aimed at alleviating the effort involved in extracting a suitable array of citation contexts. To address this, we first introduce a labeled dataset comprising 178 million sentences, specifically tailored for detecting citation-worthy content within the legal domain. This dataset is curated from the Caselaw Access Project (CAP)(2) (https://case.law/). We proceeded to assess the performance of a range of deep learning models on this novel dataset. Among the models examined, the domain-specific pre-trained model consistently demonstrated superior performance, achieving an 88% F1-score in the task of detecting citation-worthy material. To enhance our insights, we employed inputXGradient explainable AI techniques to dissect the predictions, thereby identifying the tokens that contribute to specific citation classes.

AB  - In this work, BERTurk-Legal, a transformer-based language model, is introduced to retrieve prior legal cases. BERTurk-Legal is pre-trained on a dataset from the Turkish legal domain. This dataset does not contain any labels related to the prior court case retrieval task. Masked language modeling is used to train BERTurk-Legal in a self-supervised manner. With zero-shot classification, BERTurk-Legal provides state-of-the-art results on the dataset consisting of legal cases of the Court of Cassation of Turkey. The results of the experiments show the necessity of developing language models specific to the Turkish law domain.
