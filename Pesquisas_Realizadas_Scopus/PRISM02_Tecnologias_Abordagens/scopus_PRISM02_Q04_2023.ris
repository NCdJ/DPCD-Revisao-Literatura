AB  - The use of BERT, one of the most popular language models, has led to improvements in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. One such task is Named Entity Recognition (NER) i.e. automatic identification of named entities such as location, person, organization, etc. from a given text. It is also an important base step for many NLP tasks such as information extraction and argumentation mining. Even though there is much research done on NER using BERT and other popular language models, the same is not explored in detail when it comes to Legal NLP or Legal Tech. Legal NLP applies various NLP techniques such as sentence similarity or NER specifically on legal data. There are only a handful of models for NER tasks using BERT language models, however, none of these are aimed at legal documents in German. In this paper, we fine-tune a popular BERT language model trained on German data (German BERT) on a Legal Entity Recognition (LER) dataset. To make sure our model is not overfitting, we performed a stratified 10-fold cross-validation. The results we achieve by fine-tuning German BERT on the LER dataset outperform the BiLSTM-CRF+ model used by the authors of the same LER dataset. Finally, we make the model openly available via HuggingFace. © 2023 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - The use of language models in the legal NLP field has brought significant advances in the use of AI systems to support legal professionals. However, most of the efforts so far have focused on processing documents such as legal cases, contracts and statutes. There are several types of legal resources that are still overlooked, and these include constitutions. A constitution establishes the basic principles, structures, functions and powers of a country’s governance. Several portions of the constitutions are devoted to rights and duties of the citizens, which are essential to define and protect the status of citizens as individuals and as members of the society. To this regard, in this work we focus on the range of topics covered in the European constitutions that guarantee rights and duties to citizens. We present the first study providing lexical and semantic similarity analysis of the European constitutions, which especially takes advantage of using several Transformer-based models. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Legal text is significantly different from English text (e.g. Wikipedia, News) used for training most natural language processing (NLP) algorithms. As a result, the state of the art algorithms (e.g. GPT-3, BERT derivatives), need additional effort (e.g. fine-tuning and further pre-training) to achieve optimal performance on legal text. Hence there is a need to create separate NLP data sets and benchmarks for legal text which are challenging and focus on tasks specific to legal systems. This will spur innovation in applications of NLP for legal text and will benefit AI community and legal fraternity. This paper focuses on an empirical review of the existing work in the use of NLP in Indian legal text and proposes ideas to create new benchmarks for Indian Legal NLP. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) can appear to generate expert advice on legal matters. However, at closer analysis, some of the advice provided has proven unsound or erroneous. We tested LLMs' performance in the procedural and technical area of insolvency law in which our team has relevant expertise. This paper demonstrates that statistically more accurate results to evaluation questions come from a design which adds a curated knowledge base to produce quality responses when querying LLMs. We evaluated our bot head-to-head on an unseen test set of twelve questions about insolvency law against the unmodified versions of gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 with a mark scheme similar to those used in examinations in law schools. On the 'unseen test set', the Insolvency Bot based on gpt-3.5-turbo outper-formed gpt-3.5-turbo (p = 1.8%), and our gpt-4 based bot outperformed unmodified gpt-4 (p = 0.05%). These promising results can be expanded to cross-jurisdictional queries and be further improved by matching on-point legal information to user queries. Overall, they demonstrate the importance of incorporating trusted knowledge sources into traditional LLMs in answering domain-specific queries.  © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The paper presents a software solution for text understanding and text generation, which finds new opportunities for being applied in the area of Legal Tech. The solution belongs to the problem domain of natural language processing and covers the gaps in legal documentation comparative analysis and generation. Modern trends in information technology implementation in Legal Tech are overviewed and summarized to generate the recommendations of text understanding and text generation solutions, practical implementation and use. Based on the attributes extracted from legal text documents, a subject area ontological model is formed to describe, organize and present the relationships between the facts extracted from documents, for example, normative legal acts, their individual clauses, subparagraphs, specific named entities, facts and their relationships. Experimental research was carried out to extract entities including facts and attributes from a set of administrative regulations which contains 537 documents. The proposed solution demonstrates the benefits of knowledge based text understanding and text generation in Legal Tech. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The calculation of semantic similarity is an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). There is a growing interest in this task in the research community, especially following the advent of new, ever-evolving neural architectures. However, this technique has not been explored in-depth in the realm of automatic processing of legal data, the area we often call Legal NLP or Legal Tech. In this paper, we aim to use semantic similarity to identify the relations between legal sentences that refer to a certain law and the law text itself. The semantic similarity score is calculated using cosine similarity between sentence embeddings. In our work, we use sentence transformers to get the sentence embeddings for our legal text. The results we achieve by using two separate sentence transformers, Cross English & German RoBERTa and all-MiniLM-L6-v2, provide a semantic similarity score of approximately 0.45 and 0.4, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In this work, BERTurk-Legal, a transformer-based language model, is introduced to retrieve prior legal cases. BERTurk-Legal is pre-trained on a dataset from the Turkish legal domain. This dataset does not contain any labels related to the prior court case retrieval task. Masked language modeling is used to train BERTurk-Legal in a self-supervised manner. With zero-shot classification, BERTurk-Legal provides state-of-the-art results on the dataset consisting of legal cases of the Court of Cassation of Turkey. The results of the experiments show the necessity of developing language models specific to the Turkish law domain. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Complex legal language, filled with jargon, nuanced language semantics, and a high level of domain specificity, poses a significant challenge for automation in handling various legal tasks. In the realm of legal document composition, a pivotal component revolves around accurately referencing case laws and other sources to substantiate assertions and arguments. Understanding the legal domain and identifying appropriate citation context or cite-worthy sentences automatically is challenging. Our research is centered on the issue of citation-worthiness identification of a given sentence. This serves as the initial phase in contemporary citation recommendation systems, aimed at alleviating the effort involved in extracting a suitable array of citation contexts. To address this, we first introduce a labeled dataset comprising 178 million sentences, specifically tailored for detecting citation-worthy content within the legal domain. This dataset is curated from the Caselaw Access Project (CAP) (https://case.law/). We proceeded to assess the performance of a range of deep learning models on this novel dataset. Among the models examined, the domain-specific pre-trained model consistently demonstrated superior performance, achieving an 88% F1-score in the task of detecting citation-worthy material. To enhance our insights, we employed inputXGradient explainable AI techniques to dissect the predictions, thereby identifying the tokens that contribute to specific citation classes.  © 2023 The Authors.
