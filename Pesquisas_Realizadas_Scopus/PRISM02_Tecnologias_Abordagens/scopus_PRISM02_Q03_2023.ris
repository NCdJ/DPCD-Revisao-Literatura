AB  - With the explosive popularity of ChatGPT and the development of AI generated content (AIGC), the new generation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has triggered people's imagination and discussion about the production mode of digital content and the industry transformation. At the same time, it also prompted more scholars' thinking beyond embracing the technological changes in the field information resource management. Based on this, we invited 6 experts to carry out related discussions from the perspective of the disciplinary construction and development of information resource management. (1) AIGC and the field of library and information service: The essence of the rapid development of AI technology lies in the improvement of people's ability in knowledge acquisition brought by the continuous enrichment of data resources and the improvement of quality. The professionals in the field of library and information service should fully understand their value and their role, give full play to the advantages of data resources in libraries, effectively utilize their expertise in knowledge organization and management, actively promote research and development of AI technology, and contribute their wisdom and solutions. (2) The disruptive change brought about by AIGC: The emergence of ChatGPT has brought subversive challenges to the library and information service field. The professionals in this field should actively promote the transformation of the AI era, seize the opportunity, and explore new growth points around knowledge production, resource discovery, knowledge relevance and scientific research ethics. In addition, they should give play to the advantages of our country's political system and intensive development policies, promote the transformation of information services to knowledge content generation service, and raise the knowledge productivity of the whole society. (3) AIGC and cultural heritage resources: ChatGPT has ushered in an era of model-driven content production and carry out innovation in the mode of intelligent service of cultural heritage resources supported by AIGC. In addition, this paper also analyzes the copyright ownership, real-time, interpretability, verifiability, trustworthiness, algorithm bias and cognitive misdirection of large-scale AIGCs. In the future, universal value rationality such as public order and good customs should be endowed with the AIGC, and the paradigm change in the field of cultural heritage should be actively welcomed and promoted. (4) AIGC and researches on intelligent information processing of ancient books: While ChatGPT plays a positive role in promoting intelligent information processing of ancient books and promoting cultural transmission and civilization inheritance, it also brings challenges in cultural value and national security, content security and information governance, information literacy and humanistic education. It is necessary to make efforts in the aspects like providing higher quality and larger scale of precise processing of ancient books in the future, so as to build a scientific, comprehensive and systematic system of information security and digital ethics. (5) AIGC and intelligent tool revolution: This paper analyzes the three elements of big data, giant model and huge computing power in the development of AIGC technology, as well as the four development directions of large and complete data volume, fine granularity of data analysis, multi-source and multi-mode semantic integration of semantic association, human-computer integration of information services and intelligent interaction. It is pointed out that AIGC will bring about the paradigm change of content production in three aspects: production innovation, automatic generation and ecological cultivation. At the same time, it will also bring challenges in technology monopoly and hegemony, network information security technology integration and other aspects. (6) AIGC and library: Based on the analysis of the core technology innovation trend in the ChatGPT model expansion, data enhancement and model fusion, this paper demonstrates the necessity and crisis of using ChatGPT in libraries. In addition, from five aspects of intelligent management system, retrieval system, recommendation system, question answering system and search engine, this paper puts forward some suggestions on the use of GPT in library service integration and innovation promotion. © 2023 Agricultural Information Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

AB  - The use of the sentiment analysis technique, which aims to extract emotions and thoughts from texts, has become a remarkable research topic today, where the importance of human-robot interaction is gradually increasing. In this study, a new hybrid sentiment analysis model is proposed using machine learning algorithms to increase emotional performance for Turkish question and answer systems. In this context, as a first, we apply text preprocessing steps to the Turkish question-answer-emotion dataset. Subsequently, we convert the preprocessed question and answer texts into text vector form using Pretrained Turkish BERT Model and two different word representation methods, TF-IDF and word2vec. Additionally, we incorporate pre-determined polarity vectors containing the positive and negative scores of words into the question-answer text vector. As a result of this study, we propose a new hybrid sentiment analysis model. We separate vectorized and expanded question-answer text vectors into training and testing data and train and test them with machine learning algorithms. By employing this previously unused method in Turkish question-answering systems, we achieve an accuracy value of up to 91.05% in sentiment analysis. Consequently, this study contributes to making human-robot interactions in Turkish more realistic and sensitive. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Along with the explosion of ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence question-answering system has been pushed to a climax. Intelligent question-answering enables computers to simulate people’s behavior habits of understanding a corpus through machine learning, so as to answer questions in professional fields. How to obtain more accurate answers to personalized questions in professional fields is the core content of intelligent question-answering research. As one of the key technologies of intelligent question-answering, the accuracy of text matching is related to the development of the intelligent question-answering community. Aiming to solve the problem of polysemy of text, the Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration (ERNIE) model is used to obtain the word vector representation of text, which makes up for the lack of prior knowledge in the traditional word vector representation model. Additionally, there are also problems of homophones and polyphones in Chinese, so this paper introduces the phonetic character sequence of the text to distinguish them. In addition, aiming at the problem that there are many proper nouns in the insurance field that are difficult to identify, after conventional part-of-speech tagging, proper nouns are distinguished by especially defining their parts of speech. After the above three types of text-based semantic feature extensions, this paper also uses the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and TextCNN models to extract the global features and local features of the text, respectively. It can obtain the feature representation of the text more comprehensively. Thus, the text matching model integrating BiLSTM and TextCNN fusing Multi-Feature (namely MFBT) is proposed for the insurance question-answering community. The MFBT model aims to solve the problems that affect the answer selection in the insurance question-answering community, such as proper nouns, nonstandard sentences and sparse features. Taking the question-and-answer data of the insurance library as the sample, the MFBT text-matching model is compared and evaluated with other models. The experimental results show that the MFBT text-matching model has higher evaluation index values, including accuracy, recall and F1, than other models. The model trained by historical search data can better help users in the insurance question-and-answer community obtain the answers they need and improve their satisfaction. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Chatbots and question-answering systems aim to provide precise answers to user inquiries, as opposed to simply providing a list of related documents as is typical of traditional search engines. To improve the chatbot’s performance, personalization techniques are employed to deliver customized information to each user based on their interests. Additionally, sentiment analysis techniques are utilized to better understand the user’s queries and emotional state. The goal is to better understand the user and his needs to deliver the required information. In this work, we propose a personalized chatbot enhanced with sentiment analysis features to provide useful and tailored information for each user. The paper details the system’s key components and the techniques employed for handling user queries. To evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we have implemented a proof-of-concept version as customer service chatbot in e-commerce applications. The experimental results obtained based on users’ feedback indicate a significant improvement in user satisfaction with the customized answers and the overall experience. Overall, this system demonstrates the potential of utilizing sentiment analysis in conjunction with personalization techniques to improve the performance and effectiveness of chatbots and question-answering systems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a combination of medical artificial intelligence and popular VQA challenges. Given a medical image and a clinically relevant question in natural language, the medical VQA system is expected to predict a plausible and convincing answer. Although the general-domain VQA has been extensively studied, the medical VQA still needs specific investigation and exploration due to its task features. In the first part of this survey, we collect and discuss the publicly available medical VQA datasets up-to-date about the data source, data quantity, and task feature. In the second part, we review the approaches used in medical VQA tasks. We summarize and discuss their techniques, innovations, and potential improvements. In the last part, we analyze some medical-specific challenges for the field and discuss future research directions. Our goal is to provide comprehensive and helpful information for researchers interested in the medical visual question answering field and encourage them to conduct further research in this field. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: We propose a system, quEHRy, to retrieve precise, interpretable answers to natural language questions from structured data in electronic health records (EHRs). Materials and Methods: We develop/synthesize the main components of quEHRy: concept normalization (MetaMap), time frame classification (new), semantic parsing (existing), visualization with question understanding (new), and query module for FHIR mapping/processing (new). We evaluate quEHRy on 2 clinical question answering (QA) datasets. We evaluate each component separately as well as holistically to gain deeper insights. We also conduct a thorough error analysis for a crucial subcomponent, medical concept normalization. Results: Using gold concepts, the precision of quEHRy is 98.33% and 90.91% for the 2 datasets, while the overall accuracy was 97.41% and 87.75%. Precision was 94.03% and 87.79% even after employing an automated medical concept extraction system (MetaMap). Most incorrectly predicted medical concepts were broader in nature than gold-annotated concepts (representative of the ones present in EHRs), eg, Diabetes versus Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent. Discussion: The primary performance barrier to deployment of the system is due to errors in medical concept extraction (a component not studied in this article), which affects the downstream generation of correct logical structures. This indicates the need to build QA-specific clinical concept normalizers that understand EHR context to extract the "relevant"medical concepts from questions. Conclusion: We present an end-to-end QA system that allows information access from EHRs using natural language and returns an exact, verifiable answer. Our proposed system is high-precision and interpretable, checking off the requirements for clinical use.  © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - We present WebGLM, a web-enhanced question-answering system based on the General Language Model (GLM). Its goal is to augment a pre-trained large language model (LLM) with web search and retrieval capabilities while being efficient for real-world deployments. To achieve this, we develop WebGLM with strategies for the LLM-augmented retriever, bootstrapped generator, and human preference-aware scorer. Specifically, we identify and address the limitations of WebGPT (OpenAI), through which WebGLM is enabled with accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness advantages. In addition, we propose systematic criteria for evaluating web-enhanced QA systems. We conduct multi-dimensional human evaluation and quantitative ablation studies, which suggest the outperformance of the proposed WebGLM designs over existing systems. WebGLM with the 10-billion-parameter GLM (10B) is shown to perform better than the similar-sized WebGPT (13B) and even comparably to WebGPT (175B) in human evaluation.

AB  - The prediction of chemical synthesis pathways plays a pivotal role in materials science research. Challenges, such as the complexity of synthesis pathways and the lack of comprehensive datasets, currently hinder our ability to predict these chemical processes accurately. However, recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GAI), including automated text generation and question-answering systems, coupled with fine-tuning techniques, have facilitated the deployment of large-scale AI models tailored to specific domains. In this study, we harness the power of the LLaMA2-7B model and enhance it through a learning process that incorporates 13878 pieces of structured material knowledge data. This specialized AI model, named MatChat, focuses on predicting inorganic material synthesis pathways. MatChat exhibits remarkable proficiency in generating and reasoning with knowledge in materials science. Although MatChat requires further refinement to meet the diverse material design needs, this research undeniably highlights its impressive reasoning capabilities and innovative potential in materials science. MatChat is now accessible online and open for use, with both the model and its application framework available as open source. This study establishes a robust foundation for collaborative innovation in the integration of generative AI in materials science. © 2023 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Medical students and junior surgeons often rely on senior surgeons and specialists to answer their questions when learning surgery. However, experts are often busy with clinical and academic work, and have little time to give guidance. Meanwhile, existing deep learning (DL)-based surgical Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems can only provide simple answers without the location of the answers. In addition, vision-language (ViL) embedding is still a less explored research in these kinds of tasks. Therefore, a surgical Visual Question Localized-Answering (VQLA) system would be helpful for medical students and junior surgeons to learn and understand from recorded surgical videos. We propose an end-to-end Transformer with the Co-Attention gaTed Vision-Language (CAT-ViL) embedding for VQLA in surgical scenarios, which does not require feature extraction through detection models. The CAT-ViL embedding module is designed to fuse multimodal features from visual and textual sources. The fused embedding will feed a standard Data-Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) module, before the parallel classifier and detector for joint prediction. We conduct the experimental validation on public surgical videos from MICCAI EndoVis Challenge 2017 and 2018. The experimental results highlight the superior performance and robustness of our proposed model compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Ablation studies further prove the outstanding performance of all the proposed components. The proposed method provides a promising solution for surgical scene understanding, and opens up a primary step in the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based VQLA system for surgical training.
