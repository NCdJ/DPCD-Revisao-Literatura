AB  - This paper explores the application of the In-Context Learning (ICL) paradigm for Named Entity Recognition (NER) within the Portuguese language legal domain. Identifying named entities in legal documents is complex due to the intricate nature of legal language and the specificity of legal terms. This task is important for a range of applications, from legal information retrieval to automated summarization and analysis. However, the manual annotation of these entities is costly due to the specialized knowledge required from legal experts and the large volume of documents. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLM) have led to studies exploring the use of ICL to improve the performance of Generative Language Models (GLMs). In this work, we used Sabiá, a Portuguese language LLM, to extract named entities within the legal domain. Our goal was to evaluate the consistency of these extractions and derive insights from the results. Our methodology involved using a legal-domain NER corpus as input and selecting specific samples for a prompting task. We then instructed the GLM to catalog its own NER corpus, which we compared with the original test examples. Our study examined various aspects, including context examples, selection strategies, heuristic methodologies, post-processing techniques, and quantitative and qualitative analyses across specific domain classes. Our results indicate promising directions for future research and applications in specialized domains. Copyright © 2024 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - Legal-BERT models are based on the BERT architecture (or its variants) and have been developed specifically for the legal domain. They have reached the state of the art in complex legal tasks such as legal research, document synthesis, contract analysis, argument extraction, and legal prediction. In this paper, we proposed four versions of Legal-BERT models pre-trained on the Italian legal domain. They aim to improve NLP applications in the Italian legal context. We have shown that they outperforms the Italian "generalpurpose" BERT in several domain-specific tasks, such as named entity recognition, sentence classification, semantic similarity with Bi-encoders, and document classification. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Perhaps the most widely touted of GPT-4’s at-launch, zero-shot capabilities has been its reported 90th-percentile performance on the Uniform Bar Exam. This paper begins by investigating the methodological challenges in documenting and verifying the 90th-percentile claim, presenting four sets of findings that indicate that OpenAI’s estimates of GPT-4’s UBE percentile are overinflated. First, although GPT-4’s UBE score nears the 90th percentile when examining approximate conversions from February administrations of the Illinois Bar Exam, these estimates are heavily skewed towards repeat test-takers who failed the July administration and score significantly lower than the general test-taking population. Second, data from a recent July administration of the same exam suggests GPT-4’s overall UBE percentile was below the 69th percentile, and ∼48th percentile on essays. Third, examining official NCBE data and using several conservative statistical assumptions, GPT-4’s performance against first-time test takers is estimated to be ∼62nd percentile, including ∼42nd percentile on essays. Fourth, when examining only those who passed the exam (i.e. licensed or license-pending attorneys), GPT-4’s performance is estimated to drop to ∼48th percentile overall, and ∼15th percentile on essays. In addition to investigating the validity of the percentile claim, the paper also investigates the validity of GPT-4’s reported scaled UBE score of 298. The paper successfully replicates the MBE score, but highlights several methodological issues in the grading of the MPT + MEE components of the exam, which call into question the validity of the reported essay score. Finally, the paper investigates the effect of different hyperparameter combinations on GPT-4’s MBE performance, finding no significant effect of adjusting temperature settings, and a significant effect of few-shot chain-of-thought prompting over basic zero-shot prompting. Taken together, these findings carry timely insights for the desirability and feasibility of outsourcing legally relevant tasks to AI models, as well as for the importance for AI developers to implement rigorous and transparent capabilities evaluations to help secure safe and trustworthy AI. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - With the infusion of information and communications technology (ICT) in legal domain, of late, the attempts of reforming the judicial landscape have been forthcoming. In this vein, the paper seeks to present the possibility of harnessing natural language processing (NLP) for instituting legal automated (teller) machines (LAMs) in India as an innovative application of legal informatics in a developing country. Literature on legal informatics with a focus on NLP is scanned to drive home the key argument in the paper. Institutionalization of LAMs in a developing country like India would go a long way in expediting the automated judicial arbitration system apart from providing easier and accessible alternatives to the aggrieved parties. However, it is important that the required political will and sustained leadership is there to provide the required wherewithal for the institutionalization of LA(t)Ms in the country. As an innovation in the field of legal informatics, LAM is the first of its kind both in terms of its ideation and in terms of the academic output till date. It is anticipated that academia would be interested to conceive of improvising LAMs in different contexts post-screening of the ecosystemic determinants therein. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - In legal decisions, split votes (SV) occur when judges cannot reach a unanimous decision, posing a difficulty for lawyers who must navigate diverse legal arguments and opinions. In high-stakes domains, understanding the alignment of perceived difficulty between humans and AI systems is crucial to build trust. However, existing NLP calibration methods focus on a classifier's awareness of predictive performance, measured against the human majority class, overlooking inherent human label variation (HLV). This paper explores split votes as naturally observable human disagreement and value pluralism. We collect judges' vote distributions from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), and present SV-ECHR a case outcome classification (COC) dataset with SV information. We build a taxonomy of disagreement with SV-specific subcategories. We further assess the alignment of perceived difficulty between models and humans, as well as confidence- and human-calibration of COC models. We observe limited alignment with the judge vote distribution. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic exploration of calibration to human judgements in legal NLP. Our study underscores the necessity for further research on measuring and enhancing model calibration considering HLV in legal decision tasks. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

The legal system, inherently complex and reliant on meticulous documentation, often faces challenges related to time-consuming manual processes and the potential for human errors. The system proposed provides a transformative solution to the above problems. The system emerges as a groundbreaking solution within the intricate landscape of legal systems which responds to these challenges by seamlessly integrating advanced AI techniques. At its core, OpenAI embeddings takes center stage, demonstrating unparalleled proficiency in document generation, comprehension, and abnormality detection, addressing the complexities ingrained in legal documentation. In contrast to traditional approaches, this system maximizes the versatility of ChatGPT 3.5, allowing it to not only issue commands but also proficiently generate a diverse array of legal documents. By incorporating an understanding module equipped with PyPDF, Amazon Textract, and langchain utilities, the system adeptly handles document intricacies. The utilization of OpenAI Embeddings further enhances natural language understanding. Leveraging sentiment analysis and Named Entity Recognition (NER) in its natural language processing (NLP) toolkit, the system employs an intuitive web interface for irregularities detection. The exploration of AI for automated irregularity detection showcases its transformative potential in ensuring document accuracy within the legal domain. This project, therefore, stands as a beacon of innovation, promising to reshape the dynamics of legal document processing by merging advanced AI capabilities with the unique demands of legal systems. © 2024 IEEE.
