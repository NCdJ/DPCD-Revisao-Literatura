AB  - When reviewing documents for legal tasks such as Mergers and Acquisitions, granular information (such as start dates and exit clauses) need to be identified and extracted. Inspired by previous work in Named Entity Recognition (NER), we investigate how NER techniques can be leveraged to aid lawyers in this review process. Due to the extremely low prevalence of target information in legal documents, we find that the traditional approach of tagging all sentences in a document is inferior, in both effectiveness and data required to train and predict, to using a first-pass layer to identify sentences that are likely to contain the relevant information and then running the more traditional sentence-level sequence tagging. Moreover, we find that such entity-level models can be improved by training on a balanced sample of relevant and non-relevant sentences. We additionally describe the use of our system in production and how its usage by clients means that deep learning architectures tend to be cost inefficient, especially with respect to the necessary time to train models. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - The use of BERT, one of the most popular language models, has led to improvements in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. One such task is Named Entity Recognition (NER) i.e. automatic identification of named entities such as location, person, organization, etc. from a given text. It is also an important base step for many NLP tasks such as information extraction and argumentation mining. Even though there is much research done on NER using BERT and other popular language models, the same is not explored in detail when it comes to Legal NLP or Legal Tech. Legal NLP applies various NLP techniques such as sentence similarity or NER specifically on legal data. There are only a handful of models for NER tasks using BERT language models, however, none of these are aimed at legal documents in German. In this paper, we fine-tune a popular BERT language model trained on German data (German BERT) on a Legal Entity Recognition (LER) dataset. To make sure our model is not overfitting, we performed a stratified 10-fold cross-validation. The results we achieve by fine-tuning German BERT on the LER dataset outperform the BiLSTM-CRF+ model used by the authors of the same LER dataset. Finally, we make the model openly available via HuggingFace. © 2023 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - The use of language models in the legal NLP field has brought significant advances in the use of AI systems to support legal professionals. However, most of the efforts so far have focused on processing documents such as legal cases, contracts and statutes. There are several types of legal resources that are still overlooked, and these include constitutions. A constitution establishes the basic principles, structures, functions and powers of a country’s governance. Several portions of the constitutions are devoted to rights and duties of the citizens, which are essential to define and protect the status of citizens as individuals and as members of the society. To this regard, in this work we focus on the range of topics covered in the European constitutions that guarantee rights and duties to citizens. We present the first study providing lexical and semantic similarity analysis of the European constitutions, which especially takes advantage of using several Transformer-based models. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Legal-BERT models are based on the BERT architecture (or its variants) and have been developed specifically for the legal domain. They have reached the state of the art in complex legal tasks such as legal research, document synthesis, contract analysis, argument extraction, and legal prediction. In this paper, we proposed four versions of Legal-BERT models pre-trained on the Italian legal domain. They aim to improve NLP applications in the Italian legal context. We have shown that they outperforms the Italian "generalpurpose" BERT in several domain-specific tasks, such as named entity recognition, sentence classification, semantic similarity with Bi-encoders, and document classification. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Thanks to natural language processing (NLP) methods, legal texts can be processed by computers and decision prediction applications can be developed in the legal tech field. Increase in the available data sources in the Turkish legal system provides an opportunity to develop NLP applications as well. In order to develop these applications, the necessary corpora and datasets should be created. In this work, legal case texts from the Turkish Higher Courts that are open to public access and free from personal data are used to develop decision prediction methods. Feedforward neural networks (FFNN) are deployed using word embeddings and the features extracted from texts via the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm. %85.4 Macro F1 score level is achieved. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) can appear to generate expert advice on legal matters. However, at closer analysis, some of the advice provided has proven unsound or erroneous. We tested LLMs' performance in the procedural and technical area of insolvency law in which our team has relevant expertise. This paper demonstrates that statistically more accurate results to evaluation questions come from a design which adds a curated knowledge base to produce quality responses when querying LLMs. We evaluated our bot head-to-head on an unseen test set of twelve questions about insolvency law against the unmodified versions of gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 with a mark scheme similar to those used in examinations in law schools. On the 'unseen test set', the Insolvency Bot based on gpt-3.5-turbo outper-formed gpt-3.5-turbo (p = 1.8%), and our gpt-4 based bot outperformed unmodified gpt-4 (p = 0.05%). These promising results can be expanded to cross-jurisdictional queries and be further improved by matching on-point legal information to user queries. Overall, they demonstrate the importance of incorporating trusted knowledge sources into traditional LLMs in answering domain-specific queries.  © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The law has language at its core, so it is not surprising that software operating on natural language has played a role in certain areas of the legal industry for a long time. The last few years have seen a significant upsurge of interest in this area, including an increasing number of start-ups applying deep learning techniques in the context of specific legal applications. In this paper, we present a simple yet powerful method that is applied to legal documents from different legal bodies to correctly recognize a numerous entity to find relevant information for some specific matter at hand. To the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made in this direction so far and as such our work opens a new direction of research, which will be very much useful for the society. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.

AB  - The calculation of semantic similarity is an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). There is a growing interest in this task in the research community, especially following the advent of new, ever-evolving neural architectures. However, this technique has not been explored in-depth in the realm of automatic processing of legal data, the area we often call Legal NLP or Legal Tech. In this paper, we aim to use semantic similarity to identify the relations between legal sentences that refer to a certain law and the law text itself. The semantic similarity score is calculated using cosine similarity between sentence embeddings. In our work, we use sentence transformers to get the sentence embeddings for our legal text. The results we achieve by using two separate sentence transformers, Cross English & German RoBERTa and all-MiniLM-L6-v2, provide a semantic similarity score of approximately 0.45 and 0.4, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This paper describes an approach at Named Entity Recognition (NER) in German language documents from the legal domain. For this purpose, a dataset consisting of German court decisions was developed. The source texts were manually annotated with 19 semantic classes: person, judge, lawyer, country, city, street, landscape, organization, company, institution, court, brand, law, ordinance, European legal norm, regulation, contract, court decision, and legal literature. The dataset consists of approx. 67,000 sentences and contains 54,000 annotated entities. The 19 fine-grained classes were automatically generalised to seven more coarse-grained classes (person, location, organization, legal norm, case-by-case regulation, court decision, and legal literature). Thus, the dataset includes two annotation variants, i.e., coarse- and fine-grained. For the task of NER, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory Networks (BiLSTMs) were applied to the dataset as state of the art models. Three different models were developed for each of these two model families and tested with the coarse- and fine-grained annotations. The BiLSTM models achieve the best performance with an 95.46 F1 score for the fine-grained classes and 95.95 for the coarse-grained ones. The CRF models reach a maximum of 93.23 for the fine-grained classes and 93.22 for the coarse-grained ones. The work presented in this paper was carried out under the umbrella of the European project LYNX that develops a semantic platform that enables the development of various document processing and analysis applications for the legal domain. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI), specifically, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is being hailed as a new breeding ground for immense innovation potential. Researchers believe that NLP- based technologies could help to solve societal issues such as equality and inclusion, education, health, and hunger, climate action etc., and many more. Tackling these questions requires a concerted, collaborative effort across all sectors of society. The first Symposium on NLP for Social Good (NSG) was a novel effort that aimed to enable NLP researchers and scholars from inter-disciplinary field who want to think about the societal implications of their work for solving humanitarian and environmental challenges. The objective of the symposium was to support fundamental research and engineering efforts and empower the social sector with tools and resources, while collaborating with partners from all sectors to maximise effect in solving problems within public health, nature & society, accessibility, crisis response etc. In its inception, we invited speakers from academia and industry to provide an overview of some areas from NLP applications such as education, healthcare and legal domains in order to provide a platform to stimulate discussion regarding the current state of NLP in these varied fields. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Over the last three decades legal service providers as well as legal departments of various firms have embraced the opportunity to apply the latest digital technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their work. Since language is central to both law-making and during the application of the law, Natural Language Processing solutions have found their way to this profession. One particular research area relates to the issue of small languages. The problem is rooted in the size of the population speaking a given language: in a small market, it is not economically feasible to develop NLP technologies as they require considerable time and effort to develop a sufficient language corpus. This paper reviews the challenges countries and jurisdictions of small languages face in light of increasing NLP applications in legal contexts, while also examining the role of the public sector in relation to addressing such issues. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Complex legal language, filled with jargon, nuanced language semantics, and a high level of domain specificity, poses a significant challenge for automation in handling various legal tasks. In the realm of legal document composition, a pivotal component revolves around accurately referencing case laws and other sources to substantiate assertions and arguments. Understanding the legal domain and identifying appropriate citation context or cite-worthy sentences automatically is challenging. Our research is centered on the issue of citation-worthiness identification of a given sentence. This serves as the initial phase in contemporary citation recommendation systems, aimed at alleviating the effort involved in extracting a suitable array of citation contexts. To address this, we first introduce a labeled dataset comprising 178 million sentences, specifically tailored for detecting citation-worthy content within the legal domain. This dataset is curated from the Caselaw Access Project (CAP) (https://case.law/). We proceeded to assess the performance of a range of deep learning models on this novel dataset. Among the models examined, the domain-specific pre-trained model consistently demonstrated superior performance, achieving an 88% F1-score in the task of detecting citation-worthy material. To enhance our insights, we employed inputXGradient explainable AI techniques to dissect the predictions, thereby identifying the tokens that contribute to specific citation classes.  © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - This paper reviews the most recent literature on experiments with different Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques applied to predict judicial and administrative decisions. Among the most outstanding findings, we have that the most used data mining techniques are Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) and Random Forest (RF), and in terms of the most used deep learning techniques, we found Long-Term Memory (LSTM) and transformers such as BERT. An important finding in the papers reviewed was that the use of machine learning techniques has prevailed over those of deep learning. Regarding the place of origin of the research carried out, we found that 64% of the works belong to studies carried out in English-speaking countries, 8% in Portuguese and 28% in other languages (such as German, Chinese, Turkish, Spanish, etc.). Very few works of this type have been carried out in Spanish-speaking countries. The classification criteria of the works have been based, on the one hand, on the identification of the classifiers used to predict situations (or events with legal interference) or judicial decisions and, on the other hand, on the application of classifiers to the phenomena regulated by the different branches of law: criminal, constitutional, human rights, administrative, intellectual property, family law, tax law and others. The corpus size analyzed in the reviewed works reached 100,000 documents in 2020. Finally, another important finding lies in the accuracy of these predictive techniques, reaching predictions of over 60% in different branches of law. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In legal decisions, split votes (SV) occur when judges cannot reach a unanimous decision, posing a difficulty for lawyers who must navigate diverse legal arguments and opinions. In high-stakes domains, understanding the alignment of perceived difficulty between humans and AI systems is crucial to build trust. However, existing NLP calibration methods focus on a classifier's awareness of predictive performance, measured against the human majority class, overlooking inherent human label variation (HLV). This paper explores split votes as naturally observable human disagreement and value pluralism. We collect judges' vote distributions from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), and present SV-ECHR a case outcome classification (COC) dataset with SV information. We build a taxonomy of disagreement with SV-specific subcategories. We further assess the alignment of perceived difficulty between models and humans, as well as confidence- and human-calibration of COC models. We observe limited alignment with the judge vote distribution. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic exploration of calibration to human judgements in legal NLP. Our study underscores the necessity for further research on measuring and enhancing model calibration considering HLV in legal decision tasks. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - There has been mounting evidence that pretrained language models fine-tuned on large and diverse supervised datasets can transfer well to a variety of out-of-domain tasks. In this work, we investigate this transfer ability to the legal domain. For that, we participated in the legal case entailment task of COLIEE 2021, in which we use such models with no adaptations to the target domain. Our submissions achieved the highest scores, surpassing the second-best submission by more than six percentage points. Our experiments confirm a counter-intuitive result in the new paradigm of pretrained language models: given limited labeled data, models with little or no adaption to the target task can be more robust to changes in the data distribution than models fine-tuned on it.

AB  - This paper explores the application of the In-Context Learning (ICL) paradigm for Named Entity Recognition (NER) within the Portuguese language legal domain. Identifying named entities in legal documents is complex due to the intricate nature of legal language and the specificity of legal terms. This task is important for a range of applications, from legal information retrieval to automated summarization and analysis. However, the manual annotation of these entities is costly due to the specialized knowledge required from legal experts and the large volume of documents. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLM) have led to studies exploring the use of ICL to improve the performance of Generative Language Models (GLMs). In this work, we used Sabiá, a Portuguese language LLM, to extract named entities within the legal domain. Our goal was to evaluate the consistency of these extractions and derive insights from the results. Our methodology involved using a legal-domain NER corpus as input and selecting specific samples for a prompting task. We then instructed the GLM to catalog its own NER corpus, which we compared with the original test examples. Our study examined various aspects, including context examples, selection strategies, heuristic methodologies, post-processing techniques, and quantitative and qualitative analyses across specific domain classes. Our results indicate promising directions for future research and applications in specialized domains. Copyright © 2024 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - Legal text is significantly different from English text (e.g. Wikipedia, News) used for training most natural language processing (NLP) algorithms. As a result, the state of the art algorithms (e.g. GPT-3, BERT derivatives), need additional effort (e.g. fine-tuning and further pre-training) to achieve optimal performance on legal text. Hence there is a need to create separate NLP data sets and benchmarks for legal text which are challenging and focus on tasks specific to legal systems. This will spur innovation in applications of NLP for legal text and will benefit AI community and legal fraternity. This paper focuses on an empirical review of the existing work in the use of NLP in Indian legal text and proposes ideas to create new benchmarks for Indian Legal NLP. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) based approaches have recently become very popular for studies in legal domain. In this work, the outcomes of the cases of the Court of Cassation of Turkey were predicted with the use of Deep Learning models. These models are GRU, LSTM and BiLSTM which are variants of the recurrent neural network. Models saw only fact description parts of the case decision texts during training. Firstly, the models were trained with the word embeddings that were created from the texts from daily language. Then, the models were trained with the word embeddings that were created from downloaded legal cases from Turkish courts. The results of the experiments on the models are given in a comparative and detailed manner. It is observed based on this study and the past studies that the outcomes of the Court of Cassation can be predicted with higher accuracy than most of the courts that were investigated in previous legal NLP studies. The model which is best at predicting decisions is GRU. The GRU model achieves 96.8% accuracy in the decision prediction task. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Perhaps the most widely touted of GPT-4’s at-launch, zero-shot capabilities has been its reported 90th-percentile performance on the Uniform Bar Exam. This paper begins by investigating the methodological challenges in documenting and verifying the 90th-percentile claim, presenting four sets of findings that indicate that OpenAI’s estimates of GPT-4’s UBE percentile are overinflated. First, although GPT-4’s UBE score nears the 90th percentile when examining approximate conversions from February administrations of the Illinois Bar Exam, these estimates are heavily skewed towards repeat test-takers who failed the July administration and score significantly lower than the general test-taking population. Second, data from a recent July administration of the same exam suggests GPT-4’s overall UBE percentile was below the 69th percentile, and ∼48th percentile on essays. Third, examining official NCBE data and using several conservative statistical assumptions, GPT-4’s performance against first-time test takers is estimated to be ∼62nd percentile, including ∼42nd percentile on essays. Fourth, when examining only those who passed the exam (i.e. licensed or license-pending attorneys), GPT-4’s performance is estimated to drop to ∼48th percentile overall, and ∼15th percentile on essays. In addition to investigating the validity of the percentile claim, the paper also investigates the validity of GPT-4’s reported scaled UBE score of 298. The paper successfully replicates the MBE score, but highlights several methodological issues in the grading of the MPT + MEE components of the exam, which call into question the validity of the reported essay score. Finally, the paper investigates the effect of different hyperparameter combinations on GPT-4’s MBE performance, finding no significant effect of adjusting temperature settings, and a significant effect of few-shot chain-of-thought prompting over basic zero-shot prompting. Taken together, these findings carry timely insights for the desirability and feasibility of outsourcing legally relevant tasks to AI models, as well as for the importance for AI developers to implement rigorous and transparent capabilities evaluations to help secure safe and trustworthy AI. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - A significant challenge in the legal domain is to organize and summarize a constantly growing collection of legal documents, uncovering hidden topics, or themes, that later can support tasks such as legal case retrieval and legal judgment prediction. This massive amount of digital legal documents, combined with the inherent complexity of judiciary systems worldwide, presents a promising scenario for Machine Learning solutions, mainly those taking advantage of all the advancements in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is in this scenario that Jusbrasil, the largest legal tech company in Brazil, is situated. Using a dataset partially curated by the Jusbrasil legal team, we explore topic modeling solutions using state of the art language models, trained with legal Portuguese documents, to automatically organize and summarize this complex collection of documents. Instead of using an entire legal case, which usually is composed of many pages, we show that it is possible to efficiently organize the collection using the syllabus (in Portuguese, ementa jurisprudencial) from each court decision as they concisely summarize the main points presented by the entire decision. © 2022 ACM.

AB  - This paper proposes an approach to the design of an ethical human-AI reasoning support system for decision makers in refugee law. In the context of refugee status determination, practitioners mostly rely on text data. We therefore investigate human-AI cooperation in legal natural language processing. Specifically, we want to determine which design methods can be transposed to legal text analytics. Although little work has been done so far on human-centered design methods applicable to the legal domain, we assume that introducing iterative cooperation and user engagement in the design process is (1) a method to reduce technical limitations of an NLP system and (2) that it will help design more ethical and effective applications by taking users' preferences and feedback into account. The proposed methodology is based on three main design steps: cognitive process formalization in models understandable by both humans and computers, speculative design of prototypes, and semi-directed interviews with a sample of potential users. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - With the infusion of information and communications technology (ICT) in legal domain, of late, the attempts of reforming the judicial landscape have been forthcoming. In this vein, the paper seeks to present the possibility of harnessing natural language processing (NLP) for instituting legal automated (teller) machines (LAMs) in India as an innovative application of legal informatics in a developing country. Literature on legal informatics with a focus on NLP is scanned to drive home the key argument in the paper. Institutionalization of LAMs in a developing country like India would go a long way in expediting the automated judicial arbitration system apart from providing easier and accessible alternatives to the aggrieved parties. However, it is important that the required political will and sustained leadership is there to provide the required wherewithal for the institutionalization of LA(t)Ms in the country. As an innovation in the field of legal informatics, LAM is the first of its kind both in terms of its ideation and in terms of the academic output till date. It is anticipated that academia would be interested to conceive of improvising LAMs in different contexts post-screening of the ecosystemic determinants therein. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - In this work, BERTurk-Legal, a transformer-based language model, is introduced to retrieve prior legal cases. BERTurk-Legal is pre-trained on a dataset from the Turkish legal domain. This dataset does not contain any labels related to the prior court case retrieval task. Masked language modeling is used to train BERTurk-Legal in a self-supervised manner. With zero-shot classification, BERTurk-Legal provides state-of-the-art results on the dataset consisting of legal cases of the Court of Cassation of Turkey. The results of the experiments show the necessity of developing language models specific to the Turkish law domain. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - BERT has achieved impressive performance in several NLP tasks. However, there has been limited investigation on its adaptation guidelines in specialised domains. Here we focus on the legal domain, where we explore several approaches for applying BERT models to downstream legal tasks, evaluating on multiple datasets. Our findings indicate that the previous guidelines for pre-training and fine-tuning, often blindly followed, do not always generalize well in the legal domain. Thus we propose a systematic investigation of the available strategies when applying BERT in specialised domains. These are: (a) use the original BERT out of the box, (b) adapt BERT by additional pre-training on domain-specific corpora, and (c) pre-train BERT from scratch on domain-specific corpora. We also propose a broader hyper-parameter search space when fine-tuning for downstream tasks and we release LEGAL-BERT, a family of BERT models intended to assist legal NLP research, computational law, and legal technology applications. © 2020 Association for Computational Linguistics

AB  - Legal Tech is developed to help people with legal services and solve legal problems via machines. To achieve this, one of the key requirements for machines is to utilize legal knowledge and comprehend legal context. This can be fulfilled by natural language processing (NLP) techniques, for instance, text representation, text categorization, question answering (QA) and natural language inference, etc. To this end, we introduce a freely available Chinese Legal Tech system (IFlyLegal) that benefits from multiple NLP tasks. It is an integrated system that performs legal consulting, multi-way law searching, and legal document analysis by exploiting techniques such as deep contextual representations and various attention mechanisms. To our knowledge, IFlyLegal is the first Chinese legal system that employs up-to-date NLP techniques and caters for needs of different user groups, such as lawyers, judges, procurators, and clients. Since Jan, 2019, we have gathered 2,349 users and 28,238 page views (till June, 23, 2019). © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - This paper introduces DeepParliament, a legal domain Benchmark Dataset that gathers bill documents and metadata and performs various bill status classification tasks. The proposed dataset text covers a broad range of bills from 1986 to the present and contains richer information on parliament bill content. Data collection, detailed statistics and analyses are provided in the paper. Moreover, we experimented with different types of models ranging from RNN to pretrained and reported the results. We are proposing two new benchmarks: Binary and Multi-Class Bill Status classification. Models developed for bill documents and relevant supportive tasks may assist Members of Parliament (MPs), presidents, and other legal practitioners. It will help review or prioritise bills, thus speeding up the billing process, improving the quality of decisions and reducing the time consumption in both houses. Considering that the foundation of the country's democracy is Parliament and state legislatures, we anticipate that our research will be an essential addition to the Legal NLP community. This work will be the first to present a Parliament bill prediction task. In order to improve the accessibility of legal AI resources and promote reproducibility, we have made our code and dataset publicly accessible at github.com/monk1337/DeepParliament. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - The paper presents a software solution for text understanding and text generation, which finds new opportunities for being applied in the area of Legal Tech. The solution belongs to the problem domain of natural language processing and covers the gaps in legal documentation comparative analysis and generation. Modern trends in information technology implementation in Legal Tech are overviewed and summarized to generate the recommendations of text understanding and text generation solutions, practical implementation and use. Based on the attributes extracted from legal text documents, a subject area ontological model is formed to describe, organize and present the relationships between the facts extracted from documents, for example, normative legal acts, their individual clauses, subparagraphs, specific named entities, facts and their relationships. Experimental research was carried out to extract entities including facts and attributes from a set of administrative regulations which contains 537 documents. The proposed solution demonstrates the benefits of knowledge based text understanding and text generation in Legal Tech. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Trend of Legal Tech is actively developing, thus, allowing an automation of various legal tasks solved both by professional lawyers and ordinary (common) users. Because of the legal documents properties, natural language processing (NLP) technologies are widely used in Legal Tech development. One of the tasks in Legal Tech, whose solution is necessary for both professionals and non-professionals, is a validation documents’ texts, including certain checking for the presence of mandatory structural elements in them. This article considers an implementation of a method and an algorithm for validating, for instance, the documents called “Consent to the personal data processing” in the Russian Language legal practice based on machine learning and using an associative-ontological representation of the text. Such validation occurs by checking documents through a set of rules, at that, each rule describes the documents’ structural elements. Associative ontological representation of the text makes such rules human-readable, and simplifies their adjustment and fine-tuning to the changing legislation norms. Results of experimental verification of the proposed algorithm on a set of texts of real legal documents show its effectiveness when applied to Legal Tech systems. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
