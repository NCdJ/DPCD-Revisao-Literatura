AB  - In recent times, service robots (SR) have become widely accepted in a variety of fields as an alternative to traditional reception methods. Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven systems are seen as efficient labor alternatives, resulting in several SR models already being developed, primarily designed for English-speaking environments. Despite a large Bangla-speaking population, the exploration and implementation of Bangla language support within AI reception systems remain unexplored due to limited resources, posing significant challenges for deployment. This study presents a novel AI-enabled receptionist framework tailored to Bangla-speaking environments, addressing the limitation of Bangla language resources for developing automated reception systems. Leveraging advanced AI technologies including Face Recognition, Speaker Recognition, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech Synthesis, and Question Answering System, our integrated system demonstrates promise to automate Bangla reception systems. Our suite of models yields positive performance, with a face recognition accuracy of 99.38%, a speaker recognition system with 5.83 Equal Error Rate (ERR), ASR model achieving a Word Error Rate (WER) of 9.005%, TTS model scoring a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 4.10, and a question-answering system with a validation loss of 0.03%. Real-world evaluation among 1664 users in a university setting achieved over 75% user satisfaction, with 88% expressing interest in real-life implementation, showcasing usability across different domains. Limitations such as limited training data, scalability, and environmental sensitivity persist, underscoring the need for further development. Nevertheless, our framework demonstrates potential for real-life implementation, fostering human-robot interaction in Bangla-speaking contexts and paving the way for future innovations in AI-driven Bangla receptionist systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Question-answering systems are recognized as popular and frequently effective means of information seeking on the web. In such systems, information seekers can receive a concise response to their queries by presenting their questions in natural language. Interactive question answering is a recently proposed and increasingly popular solution that resides at the intersection of question answering and dialogue systems. On the one hand, the user can ask questions in normal language and locate the actual response to her inquiry; on the other hand, the system can prolong the question-answering session into a dialogue if there are multiple probable replies, very few, or ambiguities in the initial request. By permitting the user to ask more questions, interactive question answering enables users to interact with the system and receive more precise results dynamically.This survey offers a detailed overview of the interactive question-answering methods that are prevalent in current literature. It begins by explaining the foundational principles of question-answering systems, hence defining new notations and taxonomies to combine all identified works inside a unified framework. The reviewed published work on interactive question-answering systems is then presented and examined in terms of its proposed methodology, evaluation approaches, and dataset/application domain. We also describe trends surrounding specific tasks and issues raised by the community, so shedding light on the future interests of scholars. Our work is further supported by a GitHub page synthesizing all the major topics covered in this literature study. https://sisinflab.github.io/interactive-question-answering-systems-survey/  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - With the continuous breakthrough of natural language processing, the application of intelligent question-answering technology in electric power systems has attracted wide attention. However, at present, the traditional question-answering system has poor performance and is difficult to apply in engineering practice. This paper proposes an improved BERTserini algorithm for the intelligent answering of electric power regulations based on a BERT model. The proposed algorithm is implemented in two stages. The first stage is the text-segmentation stage, where a multi-document long text preprocessing technique is utilized that accommodates the rules and regulations text, and then Anserini is used to extract paragraphs with high relevance to the given question. The second stage is the answer-generation and source-retrieval stage, where a two-step fine-tuning based on the Chinese BERT model is applied to generate precise answers based on given questions, while the information regarding documents, chapters, and page numbers of these answers are also output simultaneously. The algorithm proposed in this paper eliminates the necessity for the manual organization of professional question–answer pairs, thereby effectively reducing the manual labor cost compared to traditional question-answering systems. Additionally, this algorithm exhibits a higher degree of exact match rate and a faster response time for providing answers. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives: Question answering (QA) systems have the potential to improve the quality of clinical care by providing health professionals with the latest and most relevant evidence. However, QA systems have not been widely adopted. This systematic review aims to characterize current medical QA systems, assess their suitability for healthcare, and identify areas of improvement. Materials and methods: We searched PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, ACL Anthology, and forward and backward citations on February 7, 2023. We included peer-reviewed journal and conference papers describing the design and evaluation of biomedical QA systems. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. We conducted a narrative synthesis and risk of bias assessment for each study. We assessed the utility of biomedical QA systems. Results: We included 79 studies and identified themes, including question realism, answer reliability, answer utility, clinical specialism, systems, usability, and evaluation methods. Clinicians' questions used to train and evaluate QA systems were restricted to certain sources, types and complexity levels. No system communicated confidence levels in the answers or sources. Many studies suffered from high risks of bias and applicability concerns. Only 8 studies completely satisfied any criterion for clinical utility, and only 7 reported user evaluations. Most systems were built with limited input from clinicians. Discussion: While machine learning methods have led to increased accuracy, most studies imperfectly reflected real-world healthcare information needs. Key research priorities include developing more realistic healthcare QA datasets and considering the reliability of answer sources, rather than merely focusing on accuracy.  © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The success of the conversational AI system ChatGPT has triggered an avalanche of studies that explore its applications in research and education. There are also high hopes that, in addition to such particular usages, it could lead to artificial general intelligence (AGI) that means to human-level intelligence. Such aspirations, however, need to be grounded by actual scientific means to ensure faithful statements and evaluations of the current situation. The purpose of this article is to put ChatGPT into perspective and to outline a way forward that might instead lead to an artificial special intelligence (ASI), a notion we introduce. The underlying idea of ASI is based on an environment that consists only of text. We will show that this avoids the problem of embodiment of an agent and leads to a system with restricted capabilities compared to AGI. Furthermore, we discuss gated actions as a means of large language models to moderate ethical concerns. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This study introduces the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method to improve Question-Answering (QA) systems by addressing document processing in Natural Language Processing problems. It represents the latest breakthrough in applying RAG to document question and answer applications, overcoming previous QA system obstacles. RAG combines search techniques in vector store and text generation mechanism developed by Large Language Models, offering a time-efficient alternative to manual reading limitations. The research evaluates RAG's that use Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3.5 or GPT-3.5-turbo from the ChatGPT model and its impact on document data processing, comparing it with other applications. This research also provides datasets to test the capabilities of the QA document system. The proposed dataset and Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) are used for performance testing. The study contributes theoretically by advancing methodologies and knowledge representation, supporting benchmarking in research communities. Results highlight RAG's superiority: achieving a precision of 0.74 in Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) testing, outperforming others at 0.5; obtaining an F1 score of 0.88 in BERTScore, surpassing other QA apps at 0.81; attaining a precision of 0.28 in Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) testing, surpassing others with a precision of 0.09; and scoring 0.33 in Jaccard Similarity, outshining others at 0.04. These findings underscore RAG's efficiency and competitiveness, promising a positive impact on various industrial sectors through advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

AB  - The field of chatbots has witnessed a remarkable evolution in recent years, marked by a transition from simplistic rule-based structures to sophisticated systems employing advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. While most languages benefit from NLP support, the majority of chatbot research and development has been conducted in English, leaving a notable scarcity of comparable works in Arabic. This scarcity is attributed to the myriad challenges posed by the linguistically intricate nature of Arabic, encompassing orthographic variations and diverse dialects. This study systematically reviews articles that represent implementations of Arabic chatbots, revealing a discernible shift from rule-based frameworks to the predominant adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods. The results highlight the dynamic trajectory of chatbot technology, with a notable emphasis on the pivotal role of DL, as evidenced by a significant peak in 2023. Looking forward, the study anticipates a more sophisticated future for chatbot development, driven by ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and NLP, offering valuable insights into the current state of Arabic chatbot research and laying the foundation for continued exploration in this evolving and dynamic field. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - The robot video question-answering system is an artificial intelligence application that integrates computer vision and natural language processing technologies. Recently, it has received widespread attention, especially with the rapid development of large language models (LLMs). The core technical challenge lies in the application of visual question answering (VQA). However, visual question answering currently faces several challenges. Firstly, the acquisition of human annotations is costly, and secondly, existing models require expensive retraining when replacing a particular module. We propose the VLM2LLM model, which significantly improves the performance of multimodal question-answering tasks by integrating visual-language matching and large-scale language models. Specifically, it overcomes the limitations of requiring massive computational resources for training and inference in previous models. Furthermore, it allows for the upgrading of our LLM version according to the latest research advancements and needs. The results demonstrate that the VLM2LLM model achieves the highest accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art models on three datasets: QAv2, A-OKVQA, and OK-VQA. We hope that the VLM2LLM model can drive advancements in the field of robot video question-answering and provide innovative solutions for a wider range of application domains. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The increasing number of attacks exploiting system vulnerabilities in recent years underpins the growing importance of security; especially for software comprising configuration options that may cause unintended vulnerabilities. So, not surprisingly, developers discuss secure software configurations extensively, for instance, via community-question-answering systems like Stack Overflow. In this exploratory study, we analyzed 651 Stack Overflow posts from 2013 until 2022 to investigate what vulnerabilities in the context of configuring software developers discuss. We employed a manual data analysis and automated topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify and classify relevant topics and contexts. Our results show that vulnerabilities in the context of configuring receive more and more interest, with most posts discussing issues related to faulty security configurations and dependencies causing vulnerabilities that could be or have actually been exploited. Overall, we contribute insights into configuration and security issues that developers experience in the real world. Such insights help researchers and practitioners understand and resolve these issues, thereby guiding future improvements.  © 2024 ACM.
