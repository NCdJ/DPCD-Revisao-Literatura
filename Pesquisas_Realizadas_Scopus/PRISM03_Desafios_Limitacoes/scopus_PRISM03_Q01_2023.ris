AB  - Deep learning, owing to its transformative influence across a myriad of sectors, has recently made its foray into the legal domain, instigated by the surge in digitization. Among the multitude of applications in this space, legal document classification emerges as a pivotal yet complex undertaking. Legal texts, characterized by unique domain-centric semantics and intricate linguistic patterns, necessitate precision-driven classification systems for numerous practical implications. This paper illuminates the challenges and opportunities in automating the classification of European Union (EU) legal documents, emphasizing the interrelationships among statutes and the hierarchical nature of legal references. In this context, we introduce a novel graph data modeling technique that adeptly marries content-centric indicators with the relational dynamics inherent among diverse legal documents. Central to our approach is a framework that melds text embeddings with graph neural networks for the classification of legal documents aligned with their subject-based directories. Empirical evaluations on the EU law dataset underline the efficacy of our model across varying granularities, from general thematic categories to intricate subtopics. This endeavor not only augments the comprehensibility and accessibility of EU jurisprudence but also holds significant implications across regulatory compliance, legal research, and policy formulation, underscoring the potential of deep learning in reshaping legal paradigms.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Automated formalization of legal texts in order to remove ambiguities, conflicts and incompleteness has been a challenge for Requirements Engineering (RE) research for decades. This work seeks to make an incremental step towards this objective for legal contracts by making use of contract templates. Our proposed approach starts with a natural language contract template, together with a manually formalized specification of that template. A contract writer can make customizations to the template, which trigger the automatic formalization of the corresponding customized contract. Our target specification language is Symboleo, which is created specifically for contract verification and monitoring. Starting with a manually formalized template reduces the complexity associated with a fully automated formalization. Typical contract templates use simple fill-in-the-blank parameters, which serve as customizations to formalize in our framing of the problem. Our approach pushes the boundaries of these templates by allowing the contract writer to enter complex natural language customizations, such as prepositional phrases and conditional statements. This work explores what types of natural language patterns can be used in that context by analyzing relevant linguistics and real legal contracts. It also introduces a tool, SymboleoNLP, that suggests the feasibility of the formalization process.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The contract review process can be a costly and time-consuming task for lawyers and clients alike, requiring significant effort to identify and evaluate the legal implications of individual clauses. To address this challenge, we propose the use of natural language processing techniques, specifically text classification based on deontic tags, to streamline the process. Our research question is whether natural language processing techniques, specifically dense vector embeddings, can help semi-automate the contract review process and reduce time and costs for legal professionals reviewing deontic modalities in contracts. In this study, we create a domain-specific dataset and train both baseline and neural network models for contract sentence classification. This approach offers a more efficient and cost-effective solution for contract review, mimicking the work of a lawyer. Our approach achieves an accuracy of 0.90, showcasing its effectiveness in identifying and evaluating individual contract sentences. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The surge in legal text production has amplified the workload for legal professionals, making many tasks repetitive and time-consuming. Furthermore, the complexity and specialized language of legal documents pose challenges not just for those in the legal domain but also for the general public. This emphasizes the potential role and impact of Legal Natural Language Processing (Legal NLP). Although advancements have been made in this domain, particularly after 2015 with the advent of Deep Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs), a systematic exploration of this progress until 2022 is nonexistent. In this research, we perform a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) to bridge this gap.We aim to provide a descriptive statistical analysis of the Legal NLP research between 2015 and 2022. Categorize and sub-categorize primary publications based on their research problems. Identify limitations and areas of improvement in current research. Using a robust search methodology across four reputable indexers, we filtered 536 papers down to 75 pivotal articles. Our findings reveal the diverse methods employed for tasks such as Multiclass Classification, Summarization, and Question Answering in the Legal NLP field.We also highlight resources, challenges, and gaps in current methodologies and emphasize the need for curated datasets, ontologies, and a focus on inherent difficulties like data accessibility. As the legal sector gradually embraces Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding the capabilities and limitations of Legal NLP becomes vital for ensuring efficient and ethical application. The research offers insights for both Legal NLP researchers and the broader legal community, advocating for continued advancements in automation while also addressing ethical concerns. Authors

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are transforming the way legal professionals and law firms approach their work. The significant potential for the application of AI to Law, for instance, by creating computational solutions for legal tasks, has intrigued researchers for decades. This appeal has only been amplified with the advent of Deep Learning (DL). It is worth noting that working with legal text is far more challenging as compared to the other subdomains of IR/NLP, mainly due to the typical characteristics of legal text, such as considerably longer documents, complex language and lack of large-scale annotated datasets. In this tutorial, we introduce the audience to these characteristics of legal text, and with it, the challenges associated with processing the legal documents. We touch upon the history of AI and Law research, and how it has evolved over the years from relatively simpler approaches to more complex ones, such as those involving DL. We organize the tutorial as follows. First, we provide a brief introduction to state-of-the-art research in the general domain of IR and NLP. We then discuss in more detail IR/NLP tasks specific to the legal domain. We outline the methodologies (both from an academic and industry perspective), and the available tools and datasets to evaluate the methodologies. This is then followed by a hands-on coding/demo session. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The use of Natural Language Processing techniques in the legal domain has become established for supporting attorneys and domain experts in content retrieval and decision-making. However, understanding the legal text poses relevant challenges in the recognition of domain-specific entities and the adaptation and explanation of predictive models. This paper addresses the Legal Entity Name Recognition (L-NER) and Court judgment Prediction (CPJ) and Explanation (CJPE) tasks. The L-NER solution explores the use of various transformer-based models, including an entity-aware method attending domain-specific entities. The CJPE proposed method relies on hierarchical BERT-based classifiers combined with local input attribution explainers. We propose a broad comparison of eXplainable AI methodologies along with a novel approach based on NER. For the L-NER task, the experimental results remark on the importance of domain-specific pre-training. For CJP our lightweight solution shows performance in line with existing approaches, and our NER-boosted explanations show promising CJPE results in terms of the conciseness of the prediction explanations. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Deep learning algorithms have shown promise in effectively classifying legal texts, surpassing traditional methods. However, existing approaches are primarily designed for English text and lack suitability for other languages, mainly Portuguese. This study addresses the challenge of classifying legal basis in first-degree sentences within Brazilian law by fine-tuning the multilingual MultiFit model using a novel basis dataset, comprehensively training the model for accurate legal basis classification. The bidirectional deep-learning MultiFit model has been subjected to rigorous fine-tuning, resulting in exceptional performance while maintaining consistently high quality. Results obtained highlight the model’s remarkable proficiency in precisely categorizing legal bases in first-degree sentences, achieving an accuracy rate of 80.0%, precision of 83.3%, recall of 80.7%, and an F1 score of 82.0%. These results demonstrate the model’s adaptability, versatility, and suitability for legal applications. In addition, it exhibits high precision, accuracy, and efficiency in classifying legal bases in first-degree sentences. Moreover, successfully fine-tuning pre-trained models for new tasks, leveraging extensive datasets, highlights their significant potential in enhancing performance in legal applications. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Reading comprehension of legal text can be a particularly challenging task due to the length and complexity of legal clauses and a shortage of expert-annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce the Merger Agreement Understanding Dataset (MAUD), an expert-annotated reading comprehension dataset based on the American Bar Association's 2021 Public Target Deal Points Study, with over 39,000 examples and over 47,000 total annotations. Our fine-tuned Transformer baselines show promising results, with models performing well above random on most questions. However, on a large subset of questions, there is still room for significant improvement. As the only expert-annotated merger agreement dataset, MAUD is valuable as a benchmark for both the legal profession and the NLP community. ©2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.
